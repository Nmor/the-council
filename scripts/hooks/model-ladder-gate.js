// Model-ladder enforcement, on BOTH ends of the ladder.
//
// THE DEFECT THIS FILE USED TO BE. It was registered on PreModelSwitch only and could only
// BLOCK Fable, so an install that listed `fable` as available never fielded it. A gate that
// only ever says no is the inert-config trap of `wiring-and-usage-review.md` in its sharpest
// form, and the user noticed before any gate did.
//
// WHAT IT DOES NOW.
//   PreModelSwitch     — blocks a switch to Fable during security/regulated work (unchanged).
//   PreToolUse(Agent)  — resolves the spawn's role to its ladder and says which model that
//                        ladder actually picks on THIS install, minus any tier that has hit
//                        its plan limit (lib/model-exhaustion.js). A spawn that asks for an
//                        exhausted tier is denied with the rung to use instead.
//
// WHY THE SPAWN SIDE ADVISES RATHER THAN SUBSTITUTES. A PreToolUse hook cannot rewrite
// tool_input — the API offers allow, deny, or additionalContext and nothing else
// (code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks, read 2026-09-21). "Silently swap in the right model" is not
// available to any hook. The honest options are refuse-and-explain or tell-the-caller, and
// refusing every under-provisioned spawn would block routine work over a heuristic, which is
// how a hook gets switched off. The exception is the security ladder: Fable's classifiers
// refuse cyber work, so that spawn buys a refusal rather than capability, and it is denied
// outright at both events.
//
// CLAUDE_MODEL_LADDER=off disables. =strict also denies an under-provisioned strategic spawn.
