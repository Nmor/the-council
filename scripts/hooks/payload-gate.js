// Size budget: 8 KB. Check: wc -c; gate: token-budget.mjs --check.
// PreToolUse hook (matcher: Edit|Write|MultiEdit).
//
// Enforces `validate-payloads-before-coding.md`: before writing code that PARSES or BUILDS an
// external payload, the real shape must be confirmed from a live call, a captured fixture, or
// the primary-source schema. Never assumed.
//
// That rule had NO enforcement of any kind. It is also the rule that produced this
// programme's most expensive near-miss: on 2026-09-21 a provider's own OpenAPI document
// declared five collections as bare arrays, while every live instance returned {count, rows}.
// Four working readers were about to be "corrected" to match the document. A live call
// settled it in one request. Nothing had required that call.
//
// WHAT IT CATCHES: an edit that decodes a NETWORK response into our own types, in a session
// where nothing has looked at a real payload (payload-marker.js records that).
//
// WHY IT IS NARROW. Decoding is common; being wrong about a provider's shape is not. So it
// fires only when all three hold:
//   1. the decode is of a network response (resp / response / body / res), not arbitrary JSON
//   2. the file is integration-shaped by path or content
//   3. no payload evidence exists this session
// A decoder for our own config, our own test fixture, or an internal type never trips it.
//
// ADVISORY by default (exit 0 + advice via lib/advise.js), because the third condition is a heuristic and a
// hard block on a heuristic gets a hook switched off — the failure mode that makes every
// other gate weaker. CLAUDE_PAYLOAD_GATE=block to enforce, =off to disable.
