//   1. a live call to a non-prod tier   -> curl / wget / httpie / grpcurl / openssl s_client

//   3. the primary-source schema        -> fetching an openapi/swagger document
//
// What deliberately does NOT count: reading our own source, grepping for a type name, or
// running the unit tests. Those tell you what WE believe the shape is, which is precisely
// the belief the rule exists to check. On 2026-09-21 a provider's own OpenAPI document
// declared five collections as bare arrays while every live instance returned {count, rows};
// only the live call could settle it.
