# Rules Catalog

> Index of every rule shipped with The Council. Rules are the
> principles the Council enforces — every Council-mediated task
> applies the rules that match its file types and scope. Per
> [`rule-authoring-global-vs-project.md`](../rules/common/rule-authoring-global-vs-project.md),
> these are pure guidance; project specifics live in
> `<workspace>/.claude/rules/`.

The source guidance is shared by Claude Code and Codex. The `.claude/` layering
and model/runtime examples below describe Claude integration. Codex uses native
project instructions and the [compatibility contract](CODEX.md#native-compatibility-contract);
source hook references do not imply that those hooks run in Codex.

## Counts

- **`rules/common/`** — 26 concise Floor rules. With `CLAUDE.md`, 19,428 bytes
  on 2026-09-28 (bytes/4 estimate: 4,857 tokens; not billed usage).
  Measure with `node scripts/token-budget.mjs --root . --check`.
- **`rules-library/council-detail/`** — 27 preserved detailed references; read only
  relevant sections under the current [adaptive workflow](CONTEXT.md).
- **`rules-library/common/`** — 60 lazy-loaded universal rules
- **`rules-library/<lang>/`** — 100 language rules across 18 subfolders
  (bash, cpp, csharp, dart, dockerfile, golang, html-css, java, kotlin,
  lua, markdown, python, ruby, rust, sql, swift, typescript, yaml)

The clusters below catalog the Floor + the lazy-loaded common rules;
language rules are listed under
[Language-specific rules](#language-specific-rules).

## Language-specific rules

Each language subfolder contains the same five files: `coding-style.md`,
`no-discards.md`, `security.md`, `testing.md`, `patterns.md`. Some
also carry `hooks.md`. Each language rule **extends** the common
rule with language-specific banned patterns and linter configs.

## How rules are applied

1. **Always-on global rules** load on every file touch. The
   [`auto-skills.md`](../rules-library/common/auto-skills.md) rule lists
   the "global rules that auto-load on EVERY repo touch" section
   explicitly.
2. **File-type-mapped rules** load per the file-to-rule mapping in
   `auto-skills.md`. Touching a `*.go` file loads the `golang/*`
   rule set; touching a `*.tsx` file loads the `typescript/*` rule
   set; etc.
3. **Workspace rules** in `<workspace>/.claude/rules/` layer on top
   ADDITIVELY. Workspace rules may **raise** thresholds (stricter)
   but never **lower** them (looser). When layers conflict, the
   strictest wins.

## How rules are enforced

Rules are enforced through three mechanisms:

1. **Hooks** at the `PostToolUse` event — `no-discards`, hardcoded
   credentials, raw colour literals, merge-conflict markers — block
   the edit and return the violation to the agent.
2. **Linters** at extreme strictness — every language's strictest
   available linters with thresholds tightened beyond defaults per
   [`extreme-lint-policy.md`](../rules-library/common/extreme-lint-policy.md).
3. **Council review** — every Council-mediated task verifies the
   rules that match its scope. The agents enforce the rules via
   their decision authority and veto powers.

Per-line suppressions (`// eslint-disable`, `// @ts-ignore`,
`# noqa`, `//nolint`, etc.) are **banned everywhere**. If a rule is
wrong for the project, the project config changes — never the
per-line directive.
