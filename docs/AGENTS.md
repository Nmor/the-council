# Agents Catalog

> Index of every agent shipped with The Council. Agents are
> delegatable specialists — the Council protocol delegates to them
> when their expertise is needed. Total: 39 agents organised across
> the 16 Council Divisions. Pair with [COUNCIL.md](COUNCIL.md) for
> division detail.

The source definitions support both Claude Code and Codex. Tool names, automatic
triggers and model labels below describe Claude conventions. Codex converts these
definitions into native roles with the inherited parent model; use the
[native compatibility contract](CODEX.md#native-compatibility-contract) for actual
support. Work in the main session by default, with at most one justified helper.

## Each agent follows the principal-level template

Per
[`principal-level-mandate.md`](../rules/common/principal-level-mandate.md),
every agent file carries:

- **Frontmatter**: `name`, `description`, `tools`, `model`
- **Identity + mission** — principal-level statement
- **Global rules enforced** — explicit cross-references
- **Auto-fire triggers** — file globs / keywords / scope conditions
- **Decision authority** — veto / casting vote / advisory + rationale
- **Review checklist or workflow** — explicit checks with severity
- **Standards cited** — version + section numbers
- **Output shape** — structured findings, not narrative
- **Anti-patterns to reject** — concrete patterns with named alternatives
- **Pairing model** — which other agents this works with
- **When to escalate to user** — explicit triggers

## Model selection

Per [`model-tier-selection.md`](../rules/common/model-tier-selection.md),
each agent's role maps to a capability-aware ladder; the Council spawns
the best model AVAILABLE in the install (Fable → Opus → Sonnet → Haiku;
default `{opus, sonnet, haiku}` when Fable isn't present). The `Model`
column below is each agent's default for a direct spawn (its ladder floor):

- **fable** (Strategic ladder top) — hardest / long-horizon / novel
  non-security work, on installs where Fable is available
- **opus** — deep reasoning, review, planning, security, compliance,
  ethics (quality + broad coverage)
- **sonnet** — mechanical build/compile fixes, narrow-scope reviewers,
  verification-loop agents
- **haiku** — mechanical doc work (codemaps, README maintenance)

## Specialist selection

[`auto-skills.md`](../rules-library/common/auto-skills.md) maps file types to
relevant skills and specialists. This is a reference catalog. File edits do not
silently start agents. Read only needed guidance and use a bounded independent
review when it adds evidence; perform the review locally if delegation is unavailable.

Native Codex work stays in the main session by default, with at most one Council
helper for a concrete independent task. Claude uses its current runtime limits.
Do not recursively fan out, repeat intake or load the complete library. Keep the
existing plan and distinguish implemented, tested, installed and runtime verified.
