## Core Principle

**Before writing ANY integration code against an external provider, the
agent MUST read and cite the provider's canonical developer
documentation for the specific API surface being touched.**

"External provider" means anything the codebase calls out to that isn't
its own infrastructure: identity providers (OIDC, OAuth, SAML, LDAP),
calendar / mail / messaging APIs (Google, Microsoft, Zoho, Slack,
Twilio, SendGrid, SES), payment processors (Stripe, Adyen, Paystack,
Flutterwave), push services (FCM, APNs, web push / VAPID), object
stores (S3, GCS, Azure Blob, R2), ML / AI vendors (Bedrock, OpenAI,
Anthropic, Replicate), observability (Datadog, Honeycomb, Sentry,
Grafana Cloud), background-job platforms, mobile push platforms,
analytics SDKs.

The pattern this rule prevents: integration code that *looks* right
because it follows the npm package's README example but breaks in
production because the README and the provider's docs disagree, or
because the README is silent on an edge case that the official docs
spell out (token-rotation cadence, scope deprecations, tenant-policy
rejection codes, retry semantics, content-encoding requirements).

## Hard rules

1. **Locate and read the provider's CANONICAL developer documentation
   for the specific API surface.** Not Stack Overflow. Not a blog post.
   Not the README of an npm package wrapping the provider. The
   provider's own docs at the provider's own domain (e.g.
   `developers.google.com`, `learn.microsoft.com`, `stripe.com/docs`,
   `developer.apple.com`).

2. **Confirm the auth model from the official docs:** OAuth 2.0 / OIDC
   scopes (and which scopes are deprecated), app-specific passwords,
   service accounts, IAM federation, mTLS, signed JWT
   client-assertion. Token lifetime, refresh semantics, what
   `invalid_grant` actually means for *that* provider.

3. **Cite primary-source URLs in the implementation plan** before the
   first handler / lib file is written. Plan files live at
   `~/.claude/plans/` (or per-project equivalent) and must include an
   "ONLINE RESEARCH" section with at least one canonical URL + section
   per major integration point.

4. **For business / commercial vs personal-tier products, research
   BOTH and document which is supported.** Many providers split:
   - Google Workspace vs personal Gmail
   - Microsoft 365 commercial tenants vs personal Outlook.com / MSA
   - iCloud+ custom-domain vs personal `@icloud.com`
   - Zoho Workplace (business) vs `@zoho.com` (personal)
   - Slack Enterprise Grid vs free workspace
   - Fastmail Business vs personal Fastmail

   The auth model, available scopes, tenant-policy options, and
   billing differ. State explicitly which tier is in scope and how
   the code rejects the other.

5. **If primary-source docs are paywalled / restricted / unavailable,
   surface the risk to the user BEFORE writing code.** Don't guess
   from the npm package's example and ship.

6. **Stub or example code from the library's GitHub README is NOT a
   substitute for the official docs.** The provider's docs win on any
   behaviour question. The library may be out of date, may handle a
   scope the provider has since removed, may omit edge cases.

7. **Read for the EFFICIENT pattern, not only for a call that works.** Most
   providers offer several shapes for the same job, and the cheapest correct one is
   documented. Before the integration is written, answer these in the plan and write
   the answers down:

   - **Batch or per-item?** One request for N things, or N requests.
   - **Push or pull?** A webhook the provider sends, or a poll paid on every cycle.
   - **Paginated or unbounded?** What this endpoint does at a thousand rows. At a
     million.
   - **Filtered server-side or client-side?** Who discards the rows nobody wanted.
   - **Incremental or full?** A cursor since last time, or the whole collection each
     time.
   - **Partial or whole?** Whether you can ask for the fields you render rather than
     every field.
   - **Cached or recomputed?** What is stable enough to keep, and what invalidates it.

   If the provider offers a better shape and the code does not use it, say why. "I did
   not know it existed" is the answer this rule exists to prevent — and it is the one
   that produces the expensive integrations, because nothing in the code review shows
   it. A wrong-pattern integration passes every gate: it compiles, it is typed, its
   tests are green, and it returns the right answer. It is simply paying N times what
   the documented shape costs, on every call, forever (per `no-bloat.md` rule 10).

## What "canonical" looks like per common providers

The table below names the canonical doc surface — start here, then
deep-link as needed.

| Provider | Canonical entry point |
| --- | --- |
| Google Workspace APIs | `developers.google.com/workspace` (per-product subpages: Calendar, Drive, People, Admin SDK) |
| Microsoft Graph | `learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/` (resources, permissions, change notifications) |
| OpenID Connect | `openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html` (the spec itself; library docs second) |
| OAuth 2.1 / 2.0 | `datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749`, `datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7636` (PKCE) |
| Apple ID + SSO | `developer.apple.com/documentation/signinwithapplerestapi` |
| Slack APIs | `api.slack.com/docs` |
| Stripe | `stripe.com/docs/api`, `stripe.com/docs/webhooks/signatures` |
| AWS | `docs.aws.amazon.com/<service>/latest/<APIReference,DeveloperGuide>/` |
| Web Push / VAPID | RFC 8030, RFC 8291, RFC 8292; W3C Push API spec |
| Zoho | `zoho.com/<product>/help/api` (Workplace, Mail, CRM each separate) |
| CalDAV | RFC 4791, RFC 6638 (scheduling); plus each server's deviation notes |
| CardDAV | RFC 6352 |
| iCal / iCalendar | RFC 5545, RFC 5546 (iTIP), RFC 6047 (iMIP) |
| FCM | `firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging` |
| APNs | `developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/setting_up_a_remote_notification_server` |
| Twilio | `twilio.com/docs/api` |

When the provider names a specific RFC for an interoperable protocol
(CalDAV → 4791, OAuth → 6749), the RFC is the authoritative reference
even if the provider has its own quirks doc.

## Plan-file contract

Every plan that introduces a new integration must include a section:

```markdown
## ONLINE RESEARCH (per official-docs-first rule)

### <Provider name>
- **API surface**: Calendar Events, push notifications subscribe
- **Auth model**: OAuth 2.0 + offline_access for refresh tokens; PKCE recommended
- **Primary sources read**:
  - https://developers.google.com/calendar/api/guides/push (push channel TTL = 7 days)
  - https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/scopes#calendar (scope list)
  - https://developers.google.com/calendar/api/v3/reference/events/watch (subscribe request shape)
- **Risks identified**:
  - Push channel auto-expires every 7 days; need re-subscribe cron
  - Workspace admins can globally restrict the app via Marketplace policy
  - Personal Gmail accounts present but out of scope per business-only policy
```

Plan-mode work that lacks this section MUST NOT proceed to implementation.
The Architecture & Planning division refuses to sign Phase 0 without it.

## What we read does not stay implicit

The cited URLs go in:

1. The plan file (as above).
2. The `docs/provider-research/<provider>.md` file (one per provider) —
   so the citations survive after the plan archive rolls.
3. The PR description summary table.

Code comments do NOT carry the URLs (they rot — see `coding-style.md`
ban on tracker pointers in comments). The provider-research file is
the durable home.

## Platforms and runtimes are providers too

The rule's blind spot, paid for three CI rounds in a row (2026-10-06, the-council
PR #16): CI runner images, operating-system defaults and schema'd config are
primary-source territory exactly like a payment API, and none of them matched the
provider-shaped triggers.

- Round 1: Windows checkouts rewrite LF to CRLF unless `.gitattributes` pins
  `eol` — documented git/actions behavior.
- Round 2: `Path.read_text()` defaults to cp1252 on Windows until PEP 686 —
  documented Python behavior; UTF-8 content mojibakes or throws.
- Round 3: native path separators defeat posix-keyed config matching —
  documented `pathlib`/`node:path` behavior.

Each was knowable from the platform docs before the first push. Treat as
providers: the runner image manifest, the language's platform-defaults pages,
the workflow/manifest schema, and hook/tool contracts (for Claude hooks, the
`tool_response` field table at code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks — reading it settled
in minutes what payload guessing could not, via a delegated docs agent).

Delegation pattern that worked: hand the exact question to the docs agent
(claude-code-guide or WebFetch on the canonical page), demand verbatim field
lists plus URLs, and record source + read-date in the artifact. Verify at the
PINNED version the project uses, not latest.

## When to re-read the docs

- A new feature on an already-integrated provider — re-read the
  relevant subpage even if you wrote the integration last month.
- Provider deprecation notice received — re-read the migration guide
  before any change.
- Provider returns an unexpected error code — read the docs for that
  code before writing a retry / fallback.
- More than 6 months since the integration was authored — re-read
  before the next non-trivial change.

## Why this rule exists

A recent calendar / social-login feature was implemented against the
npm packages' READMEs without reading Google Workspace's actual scope
deprecation cadence, Microsoft Graph's commercial-vs-personal-tenant
`tid` claim, or Zoho Workplace's Application-Specific Password format.
The code looked right and passed local tests; production exposed
multiple edge cases the README didn't cover. The fix path was:

1. Stop the line.
2. Backfill `docs/provider-research/<provider>.md` with primary-source
   citations.
3. Re-derive the integration shape from the citations.
4. Re-write the code against the now-known contract.

The cost of reading the docs once at plan time is one hour. The cost
of debugging an integration built on guesses is days plus a P1
incident.

## Cross-references

- `done-criteria.md` — "done" claims require the provider-research
  file to exist and to be up to date.
- `docs-sync-with-code.md` — provider-research files are part of the
  docs-sync gate.
- `no-overclaim.md` — "the integration works" isn't done until the
  citations exist.
- Council protocol Phase 0 (`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`) — Architecture &
  Planning division enforces this rule.

## Learning hooks

Signals to watch + refinement candidates for this rule live in the
`council-maintenance` skill. Invoke it when refining this rule: it does not load
by itself. They are instructions for maintaining THIS ARTIFACT, not for doing
the task at hand, so they are not carried on every turn.
