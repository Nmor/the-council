## Immutability and state ownership

Prefer immutable shared data and return new values when updating caller-owned data:

```text
// Pseudocode
WRONG:  modify(original, field, value) → changes original in-place
CORRECT: update(original, field, value) → returns new copy with change
```

Rationale: Immutable data prevents hidden side effects, makes debugging easier, and enables safe
concurrency.

Local accumulators and deliberately stateful components can mutate owned state when
ownership, synchronization and lifetime are explicit. Review the actual aliasing,
concurrency and contract risk; mutation alone does not establish a CRITICAL defect.

## File Organization

Prefer cohesive files and small, focused functions:

- High cohesion, low coupling
- 200-400 lines is a useful file-size signal; investigate larger modules
- Extract utilities from large modules
- Organize by feature/domain, not by type

Repository-enforced limits remain required. Otherwise, size is a review signal,
not proof of a defect or a reason to fragment a cohesive operation mechanically.

## Error Handling

ALWAYS handle errors comprehensively:

- Handle or propagate errors deliberately at each boundary
- Provide user-friendly error messages in UI-facing code
- Retain useful error context and log at the responsible server boundary
- Never silently swallow errors

## Input Validation

ALWAYS validate at system boundaries:

- Validate all user input before processing
- Use schema-based validation where available
- Fail fast with clear error messages
- Never trust external data (API responses, user input, file content)

## Code Quality Checklist

Before marking work complete:

- [ ] Code is readable and well-named
- [ ] Functions and files are cohesive; unusually large units have been assessed
- [ ] No deep nesting (>4 levels)
- [ ] Proper error handling
- [ ] Configurable values and meaningful shared invariants use config or constants
- [ ] Shared data and mutable state have clear ownership and synchronization

## Comments — what they DO and DO NOT contain

Comments document the WHY when it isn't obvious from the code: hidden
constraints, subtle invariants, surprising shape choices, workarounds for
specific bugs.

For public APIs, document meaningful inputs, outputs, units, error semantics and
side effects. Explain non-obvious ownership/lifetime, cancellation, retry and
concurrency constraints where they matter. Keep comments accurate as behavior
changes; a comment that merely restates code is not evidence of quality. Use names
and structure for obvious behavior, and docs for the contract a consumer must know.

Comments DO NOT contain:

- The current task, fix, or callers ("used by X", "added for the Y flow",
  "handles the case from issue #123") — those belong in the PR description.
- External tracker pointers: plan IDs (`plan B2`, `Initiative I10`,
  `punch-list X`), Linear / Jira / GitHub issue numbers, doc section
  numbers, lint rule codes (`Sonar S1192`). They rot as the codebase
  and the tracker drift apart. **This includes mentioning rules in
  prose** — phrases like "to satisfy Sonar", "keeps the linter
  happy", "Sonar S6551 flags this" all violate the rule. Comments
  describe what the code is doing AS CODE, not how it relates to a
  lint rule. Banned tokens in comments (case-insensitive, as whole
  words or substrings): `Sonar`, `SonarLint`, `SonarQube`, `Sonarjs`,
  `ESLint flags`, `to satisfy <linter>`, `linter happy`, `to dodge`,
  `to satisfy <rule>`, `S\d{3,4}` (any 3-4 digit S-prefixed code).
- Placeholder markers (T-O-D-O / F-I-X-M-E / X-X-X). Open a real ticket
  or implement the change. The codebase is not a backlog.
- Suppression directives: `//nolint`, `// eslint-disable`,
  `// @ts-ignore`, `// @ts-expect-error`, `# noqa`, `# type: ignore`,
  `# pragma: no cover`, `# rubocop:disable`. Fix the code, not the rule.
- **Refactor-history / "legacy" framing.** Build as if the codebase is
  being written fresh today. The reader cares about what the code does
  now and what invariants it must preserve — not where it came from.
  Banned vocabulary in comments:
  - "legacy", "legacy code", "legacy inline", "legacy version",
    "legacy caller", "legacy contract", "legacy column queries",
    "legacy switch", "legacy monolith", "legacy fallback"
  - "byte-identical", "byte-preserved", "preserved across refactor",
    "preserved from inline", "behaviour preserved", "behaviour byte-preserved"
  - "previous N-parameter form", "previous form", "previous shape",
    "the previous monolithic body", "the original implementation",
    "the original signature", "the original 11-positional-argument",
    "matches the historical", "matches the legacy"
  - "the historical inline", "historical caller contract",
    "historical IP allowlist", "historical typo", "historically",
    "the historical else-branch", "historical drift"
  - "monolith", "the monolithic body", "decomposed from"
  - "this is the legacy version of", "kept for back-compat",
    "back-compat shim", "back-compat with anything", "for back-compat"
  - "post-decomposition", "pre-decomposition", "post-extraction",
    "pre-extraction"

  Write the rule, the constraint, or the invariant — not its provenance.
  If you need the reader to be aware of a known bug, use a `BUG(<short
  id>):` marker that describes the *current* incorrect behaviour, never
  one that says "preserved from earlier code". The PR description and
  the commit message are the right home for migration narrative.

  Worked example (Go):

  ```go
  // GOOD: describes the invariant
  // Credits the user's withdrawable balance and, when the source
  // transaction is escrow-channel, increments EscrowBalance by the
  // same amount. The unconditional second CreateBalance write is
  // tracked as a known idempotency gap — see BUG(B2).
  func (c *Controller) creditInstantBalance(...) error { ... }

  // BAD: describes provenance, not behaviour
  // Credits the user's withdrawable balance. Body is byte-identical
  // to the pre-decomposition inline form lifted out of the legacy
  // monolith; the dual-write quirk is preserved across the refactor.
  func (c *Controller) creditInstantBalance(...) error { ... }
  ```

## Mechanically Banned Patterns

These requirements apply regardless of hook availability. Claude's PostToolUse
implementation is `~/.claude/scripts/hooks/post-edit-no-discards.js`; native Codex
uses its own runtime integration. Actual enforcement depends on installation,
enablement and trust. Verify relevant diagnostics explicitly; never infer a passing
lint check or hook execution from this reference. See the installed runtime docs
for the enforcement manifest and verification procedure.

DO NOT WRITE:

- `_, err :=` / `, _ :=` / `_ = …` — **every return value must be
  bound to a real identifier and handled** (used, asserted, logged,
  or propagated). Test files are NOT an exception; bind the value
  and assert on it so a regression that changes the dropped slot
  fails the test. The same rule applies to method receivers,
  function parameters, and channel reads. The hook treats every
  `_` left-hand-side as a discard.
- `for k, _ := range m` and `for _ = range ch` — each binds a slot
  and then throws it away when a shorter form exists that does not:
  `for k := range m`, `for range ch`.
  **`for _, v := range s` is NOT a discard** (owner decision,
  2026-09-06). The blank there is the index slot, not a dropped
  return value: the index was never produced for a caller to use,
  and `for i := range s { v := s[i] }` costs a line and a bounds
  read at every site to say the same thing. This rule and the hook
  had disagreed outright for months — the rule forbade the form the
  hook exempted — which is what made trees look full of discards
  nothing was catching.
- `defer file.Close()` and `defer func() { _ = x.Close() }()` —
  Close errors must be logged. Correct shape:

  ```go
  defer func() {
      if err := file.Close(); err != nil {
          log.Warn().Err(err).Str("path", path).Msg("close failed")
      }
  }()
  ```

- Comparing errors with `==` instead of `errors.Is` / `errors.As`.
  Wrapped errors do not pass `==`. The Go `errorlint` linter rejects
  every `==` against a sentinel.
- Returning bare `err` from a function. Every propagation wraps with
  context via `fmt.Errorf("op X: %w", err)` so `errors.Is` /
  `errors.As` work at every depth.
- Empty `catch` blocks, fire-and-forget `.catch(() => null)` /
  `.catch(() => undefined)` / `.catch(() => false)` /
  `.catch(() => {})` in TS/JS — log and rethrow or surface to the user.
- `except: pass`, `except Exception: pass`, `except Exception: return None`
  in Python — log with `exc_info=True` and rethrow.
- `do { try thing() } catch { }` in Swift — log and rethrow.
- `Result<_, _>` with `_` capture or `let _ = thing()` in Rust — bind
  and handle.
- Placeholder markers in code or comments (see "Comments" above).
- Suppression comments (see "Comments" above).
- External tracker pointers in comments (see "Comments" above).
- Raw color literals in UI component files: hex (`#abc`, `#aabbcc`),
  `rgb()`/`rgba()`, `hsl()`/`hsla()`, `oklch()`, `oklab()`. Including
  inside Tailwind arbitrary-value brackets (`bg-[#fff]`). Tokens must
  come from the design system.
- `console.log` in production source. Use a real logger.
- Hardcoded credentials in any production source. Common prefixes
  the hook flags: `sk-proj-`, `sk_live_`, `ghp_`, `xoxb-`,
  `AKIA…`, `Bearer eyJ…`, `-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----`. Use env
  vars or a secrets manager.
- Go test functions with underscore in the name (`TestFoo_Bar`).
  Use `t.Run("sub test name", …)` subtests.
- Leftover merge-conflict markers.

The Claude no-discards hook, when installed and enabled, also warns on:

- `!important` in CSS / Tailwind class strings — let the design system win.
- Files past 800 LOC.

An executed hook rejection must be diagnosed; it is not evidence that other
checks ran. Resolve changed or exposed defects and required repository diagnostics.
Keep unrelated debt separate under the review baseline; do not weaken strict gates.
Do not run archived Claude hooks as native Codex hooks.

Operator override (humans only, never the agent):
`export CLAUDE_NO_DISCARDS_HOOK=off`.

## Learning hooks

Per `~/.claude/rules/common/continuous-learning-mandate.md`:

**Signals to watch**:

- Mutation on an existing object instead of returning a new copy (Immutability rule violation)
- Files past 800 LOC introduced (file-organization warning)
- Functions > 50 lines / files > 800 lines created (size discipline weakening)
- Deep nesting (> 4 levels) recurring in new code
- User input not validated at system boundary (validation-at-boundary weakening)
- Errors swallowed in UI-facing code (no user-friendly message surfaced)
- Comment introduced with banned tokens (Sonar rule IDs, ticket numbers, "legacy" / "byte-identical"
  / "preserved" framing)
- TODO / FIXME / XXX markers introduced (banned per Comments section)
- Suppression directive (`// nolint`, `// eslint-disable`, `# noqa`, `@ts-ignore`) attempted
  (PostToolUse hook blocked)
- Hardcoded credential prefix detected (hook blocked: `sk-proj-`, `sk_live_`, `ghp_`, `AKIA…`,
  `Bearer eyJ…`)
- Raw color literal added to UI source (hook blocked: hex / rgb / hsl / oklch)

**Refinement candidates**:

- New row in the "banned vocabulary" comment table when a new refactor-history phrasing recurs
- Tightening of the file-LOC warning threshold (currently 800) when small files consistently produce
  cleaner reviews
- New cross-reference when a sister rule (no-discards, no-silent-failures, no-silent-drops) provides
  the canonical home for a banned pattern
- New hardcoded-credential prefix entry when a new vendor's key shape appears (e.g., new OAuth
  provider, new cloud)
