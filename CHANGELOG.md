# Changelog

All notable changes to **The Council** are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog 1.1.0](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project follows [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

**Default-on Council, gate evidence and behavioral closure (2026-10-05/06).**
Per-request Council activation restored on both runtimes: a slim UserPromptSubmit
injector (bounded activation on real prompts; silent on prefixes, acknowledgements
and system turns), canonical registration owned by `lifecycle_hooks` (the migration
block that stripped the legacy injector without replacement is gone), and default-on
openings in `CLAUDE.md`, the Codex router and its SessionStart message (audit H12).
The docs-sync Stop gate now sees work however git recorded it: `dirtyFiles` parses
`--porcelain -z` (a trim bug hid every edit to a tracked file), committed-this-session
work counts, and a multi-repo workspace root consults its child repositories (H11).
The four failing Claude factual-discipline retests pass after absence-as-fact
instruction blocks (one preserved over-correction; bounded, rubric-aware grading),
and a 25-cycle repeated-turn compaction stress test pins the hook-driven share of
compaction as a byte-identical fixpoint. The token-budget gate no longer demands
declarations from a live home's third-party marketplace/cache/data plugin content;
runtime registries carry reviewed policy entries. Budgets raised with justification:
database-reviewer (12 KB, G1 discipline), no-bloat detail (24 KB, owner content
adopted), token-budget report tests (12 KB). The audit backlog is closed: H6 gained
an unmocked dual-advisory dispatcher test, H7 a directory-name regression test, H8
its last registration timeout (49/49), H9/H3/H5 verified already remediated, and
I1's model-exhaustion registrations are reconciled into canonical settings. Two new
findings: H13 — recorders read stdout only while the documented Bash response
carries content blocks (fixed; an absent exit_code stays fail-closed) — and H14 —
chained commands never produce verification proofs by design (documented
discipline). CI environment hardening: node_modules excluded from source census,
markdown/link sweeps and gitignore; CRLF pinned by .gitattributes; Windows path
normalization in council_hook; macos reap timeout widened.

**Skills, hooks and testing remediation (2026-10-05).** Fix the audited hook state,
command recognition, verification evidence, installation/context handling and
guidance gaps. Expanded QA, agent and language-stack procedures add fault cases,
authorization boundaries and explicit evidence requirements. Marketing strategy,
SEO, content campaigns and brand creative direction now have dedicated skills.

- Keep state private and scoped; redact diagnostics and reject malformed model state.
- Credit completed verification to the repository actually tested, including shell wrappers.
- Preserve installer reference resources and enforce instruction-size declarations.
- Strengthen database authorization, durable payment, concurrency and recovery guidance
  with compiler, private database and fault-fixture verification where applicable.
- Record all 41 source-remediated findings in [the audit](docs/SKILLS-HOOKS-AUDIT-2026-10-05.md).
  Source changes do not certify every model response: four supplemental Claude
  retests still make unsupported claims, and repeated-turn compaction remains untested.

**IDE settings and local runtime verification (2026-10-05).** Replace obsolete
Claude extension keys in VS Code, Cursor and Windsurf with registered settings.
The VS Code template adds explicit Codex startup and follow-up preferences; Claude
hook registrations now have explicit timeouts. Installation and JetBrains guides
distinguish shared templates from runtime discovery, configuration and hook trust.

- Real private Codex installations pass integrity and strict app-server discovery checks.
- Private VS Code profiles verify effective settings, restricted-mode behavior and
  initialized Codex startup in the tested trusted empty windows.
- Cursor/Windsurf coverage is schema validation; JetBrains coverage is documentation.
  GUI interaction, conversational turns and native hook execution are not certified.
- Preserve receipts and failed attempts in [runtime evidence](tests/runtime/evidence/2026-10-05/README.md).
  These checks do not update the user's active installation, settings or trust.

**Neutral product branding (2026-10-05).** The product is **The Council**, with
canonical repository `Nmor/the-council` and fork `le-yanu/the-council`. Repository
metadata, clone instructions, documentation, installer messages and IDE display
names now reflect support for Claude Code and Codex. The README removes duplicated
content and distinguishes shared guidance from runtime-specific automation and trust.
Existing runtime paths and state identifiers remain unchanged; historical releases
retain their original evidence. This naming change does not deploy pending source
remediation or activate installed hooks.

**BRAG for Claude and Codex (2026-09-28).** Add an on-demand launch-video skill adapted
from latent-spaces/brag at a pinned commit with MIT attribution. The lean route preserves
the user's model; explicit full/voice requests use Hyperframes. Creative storyboards
stay separate from the existing implementation plan, and output remains local.
Dependency and media checks distinguish installed tools from verified artifacts.
See [BRAG setup and usage](docs/BRAG.md); upstream music assets are not redistributed.

**Lower default context and delegation cost (2026-09-28).** The eager Claude contract
is reduced from 297,740 to 19,428 bytes; all detailed standards remain available on
demand. Codex defaults to one discoverable router with an optional full skill profile.

- Default to local work, one justified helper, scoped prompts and concise handoffs.
- Disable Claude dynamic workflows and repetitive prompt-intake injection by default;
  use a 100k auto-compact window and bound nesting/tool concurrency.
- Add reversible existing-install migration preserving primary models, personal
  settings and original files; optional Codex controls cap compaction and delegation.
- Add an independent 24,576-byte eager-context regression gate and migration tests.
- Make hook wiring tests read checkout settings instead of the operator's installation;
  fix memory lint falsely flagging placeholder paths on clean hosts.
- See [context controls, measurement and limitations](docs/CONTEXT.md). Instruction
  byte savings do not establish real billing savings; measure comparable sessions.

**Native Codex adaptation (2026-09-28).** A separate Python installer adds Council
instructions, compact routing (optional 153 skill entrypoints), 39 native specialist roles and five compatible
hook registrations without replacing existing Codex configuration or changing Claude.

- Transactional install, repeat-install, integrity verification and removal preserve
  existing shared files; modified managed files cause an explicit conflict.
- Project mappings reuse an existing implementation plan across agent handoffs.
- Native hooks give scoped reminders and patch-plan protection; they require normal
  Codex trust review. Unsupported Claude automation is documented, not silently enabled.
- Portable lifecycle and hook fixtures run in CI on Linux, macOS and Windows; optional
  real-client discovery verifies skills and hook registration without a model turn.
- See [Codex installation and compatibility](docs/CODEX.md).

**A model that hits its plan limit is routed around (2026-09-25).** Claude Code's
`fallbackModel` skips rate-limit and billing errors, and no hook can switch the model or
retry (model-config and hooks references, read 2026-09-25). So every Council spawn kept
asking for an exhausted tier until a person ran `/model`.

- **`model-exhaustion-marker.js`** records a tier when an error names it ("You've hit
  your Fable limit") and clears it on the next success, from StopFailure, Stop and the
  Agent PostToolUse events. A session or weekly limit names no tier and marks nothing.
- **`model-ladder-gate.js`** resolves each ladder without the exhausted tier, falling UP
  to the nearest stronger model, and denies a spawn that asks for it with the rung to use.
- **The session model still needs `/model`**: no setting or hook can switch it.
- **Two files back inside their own size budget** (`lib/bash-writes.js`,
  `post-edit.test.mjs`); the scaffold memory index now links the topic file it ships.
- **`docs-sync-gate.js` no longer guesses the project.** With no `cwd` in the payload it
  judged its own working directory, so it blocked whenever it ran inside a repo with
  changes. Claude Code always sends `cwd`; without it the gate now allows.
- **Fake keys in skill examples are placeholders.** CI gitleaks flagged four of them.
- **`node --test` counts as a verification gate.** The hook suite runs this way, and the
  commit gate never saw it, so a verified commit could only pass by running another tool.

**Hooks now reach the model (2026-09-21).** Claude Code sends stderr from a hook that
exits 0 to the debug log only (hooks reference, read 2026-09-21). Every advisory hook
used that channel, so none of them was ever seen: the intake, research, coverage,
payload and supersede nudges, the UX-writing and type-check reports, and the soft
no-discards warnings. Proved on the live path before the fix, then after it.

- **Advice travels as `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext`** through one helper,
  `scripts/hooks/lib/advise.js`. A block still uses stderr with exit 2. Stop-family
  warnings that must not reopen a turn go to the user as `systemMessage`.
- **No hook echoes its input to stdout.** Each hook gets its own stdin, and Claude Code
  parses stdout as the hook's own output.
- **The subagent gate had never fired.** It read `tool_calls`, which SubagentStop does
  not send; it now reads `agent_transcript_path`.
- **The claim wall used fields Stop does not define.** It now uses `additionalContext`,
  prefers `last_assistant_message`, and honours `stop_hook_active`.
- **The inline dev-server hooks became `dev-server-gate.js`.** A foreground dev server is
  blocked with a pointer to `run_in_background: true`, Claude Code's own way to keep one
  running with a readable log; the background form is allowed (the old block refused it).
  The build-and-test tmux reminder is gone: it was never delivered, and Claude Code now
  backgrounds a command that outlives its timeout on its own.
- **Command analysis judges what runs, not what is mentioned**
  (`lib/command-scan.js`): a `.sh` or `.git/` heredoc target no longer counts as a
  push, and gate detection has one shared list.
- **Fixed in the shared libraries**: aliases and package managers answered for
  inherited names like `constructor`; Bun's text `bun.lock` (default since Bun 1.2)
  went undetected; the no-discards manifest had duplicated and unreachable branches, a
  CSS selector bypass, and a setext underline read as a merge conflict.
- **One verdict per Python `except` shape.** `except ValueError: pass` was blocked on one
  line and allowed across two, because two rules disagreed. The older per-line rule is
  retired: a bare or `Exception` / `BaseException` swallow is blocked in either layout, and
  a named exception is allowed, which is where Ruff S110 and Bandit B110 draw the line by
  default. One swallow now produces one finding, not two.
- **Vendored library API is labelled.** Five exports with no caller in this install or
  upstream (`getRunCommand`, `getExecCommand`, `isMacOS`, `isLinux`, `grepFile`) are kept so
  the libraries stay in step with `affaan-m/ECC`, and say so in their headers.
- **Installer**: root-only excludes are anchored, so the project scaffold's
  `.gitignore`, README and `memory/` template install again. `verify.sh` names a failed
  code-graph check instead of exiting silently, and skips Claude Code's own
  `skills/synced/` store.
- **Skill splits**: 210 links moved into `references/` are rebased; seven skills whose
  standards had moved out cite them in `SKILL.md` again; the splitter now rebases links,
  refuses a split that breaks one, and keeps any `## Standards` section.
- **Tests**: 777 hook tests, from 571; enforcement-layer line coverage 93.9%, from 82.5%.

**Cold-load: ~150,240 -> ~64,939 tokens per turn (2026-09-05).** The headline fix
was not a design change — it was a bug. This repo was checked out at a path that
is a PARENT of eleven active workspaces, and Claude Code collects config by
walking up from the working directory, so every session loaded the entire Council
TWICE: once as "user's private global instructions" from `$HOME`, again as
"project instructions, checked into the codebase" from the clone. `diff -rq`
confirmed the two `rules/common` trees were byte-identical. Moving the clone to a
sibling of the workspaces halved the cold-load on its own. README, `CLAUDE.md` and
the installer now document the hazard, because any contributor can reproduce it.

Three structural changes followed, all found by measuring rather than assuming:

- **`coding-quality-rules` 225 KB -> 20 KB (91%).** The single largest cost in the
  system, and invisible *because* it was `paths:`-gated: it fires on 32 globs
  covering every code file, so touching one `.ts` cost ~56,000 tokens — more than
  the entire Floor. It was ~20 distinct rules concatenated into one file ("Hard
  rules" appeared six times as a section header; 76 H1s; zero supporting files).
  Now progressive disclosure: routing table in `SKILL.md`, 19 files in
  `references/`, and the two MANDATORY workflows kept inline because they fire on
  every code change and must never be a lookup. **A gated skill is deferred, not
  free** — that is now stated in the README and the installer.
- **Learning hooks -> `council-maintenance` skill (~7,832 tokens/turn).** All 24/24
  rules carried a `## Learning hooks` section (31,329 B). `continuous-learning-mandate`
  rule 6 defines these as "what observations matter for REFINING THIS ARTIFACT" —
  instructions for maintaining the Council, not for doing the task at hand.
  Collected verbatim into a skill gated on `.claude/rules/**`; each rule keeps a
  pointer, so the trigger stays on the Floor and only the body moves.
- **Four event-scoped Floor rules demoted (45,514 -> 14,882 B).** `rule-authoring`,
  `project-scoped-artifacts`, `plan-completion-before-push` and
  `model-tier-selection` each keep their Core Principle, a numbered index of their
  hard rules, and a pointer — a trigger, not a redirect stub. Bodies went into
  EXISTING gated skills rather than four new ones. `done-criteria`,
  `competitive-parity` and `continuous-learning` were candidates and are NOT
  demoted: they fire on a model utterance or a judgment moment, and no hook can
  precede those.

### Fixed — four inert wirings

- `evaluate-session.js` read `skills/continuous-learning/config.json`; the skill
  has always been `continuous-learning-v2`. It fell through to hardcoded defaults
  silently, since it shipped, so configured values were never read. Path fixed
  (6 config keys now load) and the miss made observable per `no-silent-failures` r8.
- All eight `django-*` / `springboot-*` skills declared **no `paths:` at all** —
  unfireable, while `golang-patterns` had 20 globs. Merged 8 -> 4 on the house
  pattern and gated on real file shapes.
- Plugins were declared-but-not-materialised: 7 enabled in `settings.json`,
  3 marketplaces registered, `installed_plugins.json` empty. New
  `report_plugin_state()` compares declared vs registered vs installed and names
  the fix; it reports and does not install, since materialising a plugin runs
  third-party code.
- A stub migration in this same release rewrote a `should_skip` clause in
  `verify-standards-citations.sh`, silently exempting a real skill from the
  citation gate. Clause removed; the skill passes on merit.

### Changed — consolidation

- `django` x4 and `springboot` x4 -> the house 2-skill pattern. The split was
  structural boilerplate (Purpose / Standards Cited / Anti-Patterns /
  Cross-References / Verification Checklist each x4), not domain content.
- `coding-standards` redirect stub retired: 19 inbound references migrated FIRST,
  then deleted (wire-before-delete). A negative lookbehind kept
  `cpp-coding-standards` and `java-coding-standards` untouched.
- Two 2026-07-23 redirect stubs deleted; their own text said they were scheduled
  for removal once references migrated. They had.

### Documentation

Every published count was stale and is now measured: README badges (122 -> 118
skills, 22 -> 24 Floor rules, 32 -> 39 agents), the "What's in the box" table
(hooks 14 -> 25, `CLAUDE.md` ~14 -> ~20 KB, lazy surface ~5.4 -> ~4.8 MB),
`docs/RULES.md` (Floor count, and a language list naming `solidity` + `terraform`
which do not exist — 20 -> 18 subfolders), `docs/AGENTS.md` (32 -> 39), and
`INSTALL.md` (now matches `verify.sh`'s own count). Four Floor rules were
**entirely undocumented** in `docs/RULES.md` — `competitive-parity-per-phase`,
`diagnose-before-fixing`, `project-memory` and `ui-ux-quality-bar` — and are now
listed in their clusters. The task intake is described as trigger-gated rather
than "29-question" wherever it appeared. `docs/lazy-loading-classification.md`
keeps its point-in-time figures: its banner declares it a historical record of the
v1.1.0 split, and rewriting those to today's numbers would destroy its value.

---

The efficiency + specialist release. Cuts the always-on cold-load while
adding capability-aware model selection and per-stack build specialists —
efficiency and quality moved together, not traded.

**Model currency (2026-07-27):** refreshed the framework to Claude Opus 5
(`claude-opus-5`, shipped 2026-07-24 as the new recommended default; unchanged
$5/$25 — Opus 4.8 now legacy). Only human-facing citations changed — the `opus`
alias in agents/ladders auto-tracks the current tier, so no agent frontmatter
moved. `model-tier-selection.md` gains an "Alias resolution & version currency"
section; `rules-library/common/performance.md` (a stale duplicate that pinned
Opus 4.7 and mislabelled the mechanical resolvers as opus) now defers to
`model-tier-selection.md` as the single source; stale version strings bumped in
the `coding-quality-rules` aggregate skill, the Cursor IDE-config template,
`cost-aware-llm-pipeline`, and `prompt-engineering`.

**Intake enforcement (2026-07-27):** task intake is now hook-backed, not
documentation-only. New `intake-gate.js` (PreToolUse `Edit|Write|MultiEdit`)
surfaces a reminder at the file-mutation boundary — or hard-blocks under
`CLAUDE_INTAKE_GATE=block` — when a project source file is about to change with no
Phase-0 intake/plan recorded this session; `intake-marker.js` (PostToolUse
`TodoWrite`) satisfies it once a plan exists. It skips framework files (`/.claude/`),
non-source files, and stays quiet after the first plan (`=off` disables). Both ship
in every install (the installer copies `settings.json` + `scripts/hooks/` +
`hooks/` wholesale). `task-intake-due-diligence.md` documents the three-layer
enforcement and `improve-prompt.py` ties its injection to the gate. A hard block on
the intake prose itself is not mechanically possible — the gate enforces the
observable proxy (a plan precedes code mutation), turning silent drift into a
visible signal.

**Competitive-parity as retrospective Step 6 (2026-09-05):** the
`competitive-parity-per-phase.md` rule is now committed + wired into the sweep
(previously an untracked local-only file). `post-phase-retrospective-review.md`
gains an explicit **Step 6 — Competitive-parity scan**, and `CLAUDE.md` Floor
rule 7 names it: every wave/part-close audits what shipped against the leading
competitors (cumulative, reference-set locked per plan), files the gaps as
next-wave tasks, and ships each new dimension's discovery/filter surface in the
same wave. New `parity-gate.js` (PostToolUse `Edit|Write|MultiEdit`) surfaces a
NON-BLOCKING reminder when a `.claude/plans/` file records a phase/wave/part
close (a retrospective-sweep block, or a wave/phase marked complete) with no
"Competitive parity" block — fires once per session, `CLAUDE_PARITY_GATE=off`
silences.

**Diagnose-before-fixing (2026-07-26):** `diagnose-before-fixing.md` committed +
wired into `CLAUDE.md` Floor rule 6 — a runtime-failure fix requires a PROVEN
root cause from the LIVE execution path (not a proxy) before the edit; when
blind, instrument first, never guess-and-patch.

### Added — enforcement, UI/UX Floor rule, vetted plugins (2026-09-05)

**Six unenforced rules gained mechanical backing.** Claude Code exposes 32 hook
events; the Council wired 7. Each of these rules named a control that nothing
implemented: `PostCompact` (project-memory — PreCompact wrote the brief, nothing
re-read it), `SubagentStop` (verify-before-claim r11, whose text records the
incident where subagents denied Bash produced zero verified output),
`PostToolUseFailure` (no-silent-failures r8), `PreModelSwitch` (model-tier-selection
— "Fable excluded from security review" was prose enforced by nothing; now blocks),
`TaskCompleted` (no-overclaim), `PermissionDenied` (council-default r4, which
specified bypass-log.jsonl and gave it no feed). Plus `gate-marker.js`, added
because task-completion-gate read a marker nothing wrote — the inert-dependency
shape wiring-and-usage-review exists to catch, found in our own work.

Every hook is SILENT on the happy path. Hook output enters context, so a chatty
hook is a per-turn tax that would undo the efficiency release.

**UI / UX / UX-writing is now Floor rule 15** (`ui-ux-quality-bar.md`). The Council
had three UX agents and seven UX skills and no Floor rule, so Division 7 engaged
only on a trigger match — backwards for the layer users actually touch. Cites WCAG
2.2 AA, ISO 9241-11, Nielsen, ARIA APG. `ux-reviewer` raised sonnet -> opus.

**Plugins enabled** (settings.json; no new files): `security-guidance` (per-edit
warnings — the one security mode the Council lacked), `claude-security` (deep scan),
`gopls-lsp` / `typescript-lsp` / `pyright-lsp` (Golden Rule 5 demands "IDE
diagnostics ALL must resolve" while giving Claude no way to see them), `ponytail`
(126.8k stars, MIT — no-bloat as a live constraint), `ui-ux-pro-max` (125.1k stars,
MIT — the design knowledge Floor rule 15 requires).

**install.sh** now reports optional capability rather than installing it: which
language servers are missing, and — separately — when one exists but its directory
is not on PATH, which is the failure that looks like a broken plugin.

**Measured, not fixed:** skill descriptions total ~9,911 tokens against a ~1%
listing budget (~2,000), so Claude Code is silently truncating least-used
descriptions. Capping per-description length does not close a 5x gap; it needs a
budget-vs-prune decision with /skill-doctor usage data. Tracked in the
capability-uplift plan.

### Added

- `rules/common/model-tier-selection.md` — capability-aware model ladders
  per Council role. Each role resolves to the best model AVAILABLE in the
  install (Fable → Opus → Sonnet → Haiku), degrading gracefully and audibly.
  Fable is reserved for the Strategic ladder and excluded from security roles
  (its classifiers refuse security work). Availability is declared per-install
  in the gitignored `~/.claude/.local/model-availability` (default
  `{opus, sonnet, haiku}`).
- Seven new per-stack build-resolver specialists (all `sonnet`,
  `mechanical-build-fix` role): `python-build-resolver`,
  `rust-build-resolver`, `java-build-resolver`, `dotnet-build-resolver`,
  `ruby-build-resolver`, `php-build-resolver`, `swift-build-resolver`. Each
  carries genuine stack-specific toolchain + error idioms + anti-patterns.
- `council-default.md` rule 11 (online research MANDATORY across collection,
  planning, and implementation) — enforced in-context every non-trivial turn
  via the `hooks/improve-prompt.py` UserPromptSubmit hook, not just documented.
- `council-default.md` rule 12 (model selection resolves the role→ladder at
  spawn time).

### Changed

- **Retrospective rules consolidated 3 → 1.** `post-phase-retrospective-review.md`
  is now the single canonical rule (five-step sweep + dependency-scoped
  audit); `phase-retrospective-sweep.md` and
  `principal-level-review-after-each-phase.md` are redirect stubs. ~34 KB of
  triplicated always-on content collapsed to one authoritative source.
- **Council speaking is now signal-gated** (`council-default.md` rule 1 + 6,
  `principal-level-mandate.md`): coverage stays mandatory (every division
  engages + records a verdict), but depth concentrates on the risk-owning
  divisions — no-concern divisions give a one-line gated verdict, and the old
  fixed "2 sentences per division" floor is retired. Shared context in,
  structured + deduped findings out.
- `task-intake-due-diligence.md` is trigger-gated (always-fire high-signal
  core + domain questions on matching triggers), and `council-triggers.md`
  slimmed (full catalog lives in the `council-rules` skill).
- `build-error-resolver` narrowed to the **TypeScript/JavaScript** specialist;
  the three mechanical agents (`build-error-resolver`, `go-build-resolver`,
  `refactor-cleaner`) re-tiered `opus → sonnet` to match their ladder role.
- Docs synced: `docs/COUNCIL.md`, `docs/AGENTS.md`, `docs/RULES.md` reflect
  signal-gating, the model ladder, online-research mandate, and the new
  resolvers.

Net always-on cold-load: **~283 KB → ~256 KB (~10 % lighter)** despite adding
the model-selection system, online-research enforcement, and the resolver
roster.

## [1.2.0] — 2026-06-28

The enforcement release. Promotes silent-failure / wiring / no-bloat /
payload-validation disciplines into the always-on Floor, adds mechanical
hook + CI enforcement for plan-marker strays, and completes the
public-ready scrub so every file ships as reusable guidance.

### Added — Floor rules

- `rules/common/no-silent-failures.md` — promoted from `rules-library/`
  to the Floor. New rule 8 (an observable best-effort swallow emits a
  metric + alert, not just a log) and rule 9 (absence-class detection via
  dead-man alerts + a startup effective-config log). The `rules-library/`
  copy is now a redirect stub.
- `rules/common/wiring-and-usage-review.md` — every new symbol has a live
  consumer; the NETWORK + INFRA path (NetworkPolicy / Service / IAM-IRSA /
  resource-applied / quota) is part of the live path, not just the call
  graph.
- `rules/common/no-bloat.md` — least code that solves the problem; no
  speculative or inert surface; every plan ends with a bloat-removal
  phase.
- `rules/common/validate-payloads-before-coding.md` — validate any
  external payload against the real contract before writing the code that
  produces or consumes it.
- `rules/common/principal-level-review-after-each-phase.md` +
  `rules/common/post-phase-retrospective-review.md` +
  `rules/common/phase-retrospective-sweep.md` — every phase boundary
  re-audits all prior phases for principal-level depth + intact
  cross-phase wiring via a different gate.
- `skills/codebase-memory/SKILL.md` — knowledge-graph query skill (cites
  ISO/IEC 39075:2024 GQL for the property-graph model).

### Changed — enforcement + hooks

- `scripts/hooks/lib/no-discards-rules.js` — `task-pointer` rule now also
  catches `GAP-?<n>` markers; new `silent-except` file rule flags
  `except: pass` / `except: ...` swallows.
- `scripts/hooks/pre-push-gate.js` — the authorized-push reminder asserts
  every changed symbol / flag / env / config is confirmed AND wired (no
  inert config).
- `rules/common/plan-task-breakdown.md` — unified the canonical plan-marker
  grammar (`P<n>.<segment>`, typed Gap / Review / Finding rows);
  deprecated standalone `GAP8` / `R-W2` forms.
- `rules/common/plan-completion-before-push.md` — push gate now requires
  every changed symbol / flag / env / config to be confirmed + wired.
- `tests/verify-link-integrity.sh` — skips gitignored runtime dirs
  (`plans/`, `audits/`, …) so the sweep matches what CI actually checks
  out.

### Changed — public-ready scrub

- Removed personal / workspace / vendor references and absolute machine
  paths across `CLAUDE.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, the language-pattern skills,
  and `rules/common/done-criteria.md` — every file ships as reusable
  guidance.
- `.gitignore` — excludes machine-local MCP config (`.mcp.json`) and
  tool-installed `cbm-*` hooks so per-machine state never enters the repo.

### Changed — dependencies

- `actions/checkout` bumped to v7.0.0 (was v4.3.1) across the CI workflow
  (folds the dependabot `gh-actions-major` group; pinned by SHA).

### Docs

- Synced `README.md` (badges, surface table, verification block,
  cold-load budget, version), `docs/RULES.md` (Floor count + the seven
  new rules catalogued in their clusters), `docs/SKILLS.md`
  (`codebase-memory` + count), and a post-release note on
  `docs/lazy-loading-classification.md` — Floor is now 22 rules, 122
  skills.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-06-02

The lazy-rules-loading release. Reduces cold-load context from ~1.7 MB
to ~140 KB (~92% drop) while preserving every rule + skill + agent's
full content. Closes the `auto-skills.md` catch-all glob that was
defeating the skill-system's lazy-load mechanism.

### Added — dual-surface architecture

- `rules-library/` — 160 lazy-loaded files (60 common + 100
  language-specific across 20 language subdirs). NOT auto-walked;
  loaded ON DEMAND via skill `paths:` triggers + skill body
  references.
- `skills/` — 13 new pattern skills (csharp-patterns,
  dart-flutter-patterns, dockerfile-patterns, kotlin-patterns,
  lua-patterns, ruby-rails-patterns, rust-patterns, sql-patterns,
  yaml-patterns, ci-rules, dependency-rules, i18n-rules,
  resilience-rules) each declaring `paths:` triggers.
- `scripts/hooks/pre-compact-council-brief.js` — PreCompact hook
  that each Core Five Council Division contributes preservation
  items to before context compaction. Written to active session
  `.tmp` so the summariser sees the structured "preserve verbatim"
  block.
- `docs/lazy-loading-classification.md` — taxonomy of what's Floor
  vs Library vs Skill-routed.

### Changed

- `rules/common/` reduced from 74 files to 15 Floor rules
  (always-loaded). The other 59 moved to `rules-library/common/`.
- `rules/<lang>/` (20 language subdirs, 100 files) moved to
  `rules-library/<lang>/`.
- `CLAUDE.md` (14 KB Floor pointer) replaces the prior ~70 KB
  monolith. Per-language verification, full Council Protocol
  templates, and Division Personas now lazy-load via skill paths.
- `coding-standards` skill demoted from 19 KB body to 2.6 KB
  redirect stub pointing at `coding-quality-rules` (which carries
  the canonical content).
- `bootstrap/verify.sh` Phase B + F rewritten to match the
  dual-surface architecture. Reports Floor + Library counts
  separately; `paths:` trigger sweep added.
- Per-workspace `CLAUDE.md` files updated to point at the new
  `rules-library/` layout (67 broken refs fixed).
- IDE config templates (cursor, jetbrains, vscode, windsurf)
  updated to reference `rules-library/`.

### Hooks (wired in `settings.json`)

- `PostToolUse → Edit|Write → post-edit-no-discards.js` — was
  orphaned (script existed but not referenced).
- `PreToolUse → Write → pre-write-governance-sweep.js` — same.
- `PreCompact → pre-compact-council-brief.js` — runs BEFORE the
  existing state-snapshot hook.
- `PreToolUse → Bash → pre-push-gate.js` — fixed to accept the
  documented `CLAUDE_PUSH_AUTHORIZED=yes <cmd>` inline bypass
  shape (was only reading harness env).

### Fixed

- 331 broken cross-references across the repo (docs, agents,
  skills, IDE templates) all rewritten to point at the correct
  Floor / Library location.
- Illustrative Stripe documentation key (Stripe's own widely-published
  `sk_live_4eC39Hq...` example) in YAML "CATASTROPHIC" examples
  replaced with `REPLACE_WITH_VAULT_REF` so the teaching surface
  doesn't trip GitHub Secret Scanning.

### Removed

- ~95 KB of bloat: stale `settings.json` backup, duplicate
  `CLAUDE.md.pre-phase-h.*` (the `.local/backups/` copy is
  canonical), `scripts/.DS_Store`, `hooks/__pycache__/`, orphan
  `hooks/hooks.json` (Claude Code reads only `settings.json`).

### Verification (release-time)

- Floor + Library: 15 + 160 files; 116 unique skill-to-library
  refs all resolve.
- `bootstrap/verify.sh` Phases A-H: all green.
- `tests/verify-link-integrity.sh`: 1076 / 1076 links resolve
  across 394 files.
- `tests/verify-no-orphans.sh`: 0 orphans across 239 candidates.
- `tests/verify-standards-citations.sh`: 113 pass / 28 skip / 0
  flagged.
- `settings.json`: 14 hook script paths, all resolve.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-05-31

The peppy-painting-parrot rebuild. Single commit covering all 17 phases.
Establishes the 16-division Council, lifts every artifact to
principal-engineer level, and ships a cross-platform install surface
(macOS / Linux / Windows-native / WSL2) under MIT.

### Added

#### Phase 0 — Safety net

- `.gitignore` excluding the 5+ GB conversation tree
  (`projects/`, `sessions/`, `file-history/`, `telemetry/`,
  `statsig/`, `downloads/`, `cache/`)
- Git baseline commit (`8a07d9c`) as the rollback anchor
- Local `.local/project-tokens` opt-in pattern for per-user
  contamination audits (gitignored)

#### Phase 1 — Orphan cleanup + project relocation

- All workspace-specific plans / memories relocated to their
  respective project `.claude/` directories
- New global rules:
  - `plan-execution-progress.md` — structured per-phase progress
  - `plan-task-breakdown.md` — long-list-of-small-tasks discipline
  - `plan-completion-before-push.md` — no push without explicit OK

#### Phase 1.5 — Global-rule purity sweep

- Every global rule, skill, agent, and command stripped of
  workspace / vendor / session-specific content
- Generic `<workspace>` / `<project>` / `<provider>` placeholders
  used throughout
- `rule-authoring-global-vs-project.md` codifying the classification
  policy

#### Phase 2 — Rule consolidation + deepening

- `no-discards.md` umbrella consolidates `no-silent-failures.md`
  and `no-silent-drops.md`-class patterns at the canonical home
- `security.md` promoted to an OWASP Top 10 + ASVS-mapped umbrella
- `hooks.md` umbrella consolidates per-language hook subfiles
- 25 shallow rules deepened with rationale, anti-patterns, examples,
  verification checklists, cross-references

#### Phase 3 — 27 new global rules

- **Resilience cluster**: `idempotency.md`, `error-codes.md`,
  `circuit-breaker.md`, `graceful-degradation.md`,
  `rate-limiting.md`
- **Observability cluster**: `observability.md`, `log-levels.md`,
  `audit-logging.md`, `runbook-template.md`
- **API / schema cluster**: `api-versioning.md`,
  `schema-evolution.md`, `contract-testing.md`
- **Lifecycle cluster**: `semver.md`, `feature-flags.md`,
  `dependency-pinning.md`, `adr-template.md`,
  `deprecation-lifecycle.md`
- **Compliance cluster**: `a11y.md` (WCAG 2.2 AA+), `i18n.md`,
  `data-retention.md`, `gdpr-ccpa.md`, `code-of-conduct.md`
- **Dev-process cluster**: `documentation-requirements.md`,
  `local-dev-setup.md`, `no-ambient-globals.md`
- **Per-language no-discards**: `golang/no-discards.md`,
  `typescript/no-discards.md`, `python/no-discards.md`

#### Phase 4 — Skill consolidation

- `continuous-learning` v1 retired; `continuous-learning-v2` is
  canonical
- `frontend-design` merged into `frontend-patterns`
- `error-shape-contract-testing`, `content-hash-cache-pattern`,
  `fire-and-forget`, `regex-vs-llm-structured-text` folded into
  their parent skills

#### Phase 5 — Domain-skill expansion (≥ 99 skills)

- **Accessibility**: `wcag-accessibility`, `accessible-forms`
- **Security / compliance**: `owasp-asvs`, `gdpr-ccpa-compliance`,
  `pci-dss-patterns`, `iso27001-controls`, `soc2-readiness`,
  `hipaa-compliance`, `ferpa-coppa-compliance`
- **Finance / accounting**: `bookkeeping-patterns`,
  `ifrs-gaap-reporting`, `fp-and-a`,
  `payment-processing-patterns`
- **Investment**: `valuation-models`, `portfolio-theory`,
  `investment-research`, `investor-due-diligence`,
  `financial-analyst`, `stock-broker`
- **AI / ML**: `ml-model-selection`, `mlops-patterns`,
  `rag-design`, `prompt-engineering`, `fine-tuning-workflows`
- **Design (UX / UI)**: `ux-research`, `interaction-design`,
  `design-systems`
- **Org / management**: `org-design`, `okr-framework`,
  `hiring-process`, `performance-management`
- **Infrastructure**: `cloud-architecture`, `network-patterns`,
  `datacenter-ops`
- **Industrial**: `lean-manufacturing`, `six-sigma`,
  `supply-chain-patterns`
- **Structural engineering**: `structural-basics`,
  `mep-coordination`
- **Innovation**: `design-thinking`, `triz-patterns`,
  `lean-startup`
- **Interpersonal**: `negotiation-patterns`,
  `communication-patterns`
- **Research**: `research-methods`, `historical-analysis`
- **Education / edtech**: `edtech-patterns`,
  `clinical-data-patterns`

#### Phase 6 — Agent expansion (32 agents across 16 divisions)

- `security-reviewer` upgraded to `model: opus`
- **Core Five new**: `infra-reviewer`, `java-reviewer`,
  `mobile-reviewer`, `performance-reviewer`
- **Extended Eleven new**: `compliance-reviewer` (opus),
  `accessibility-reviewer` (opus), `ux-reviewer`, `ops-reviewer`,
  `data-reviewer`, `finance-reviewer`, `risk-reviewer`,
  `strategy-reviewer`, `people-reviewer`, `esg-reviewer`,
  `ai-ethics-reviewer` (opus), `comms-reviewer`
- **Domain sub-leads**: `payments-reviewer` (opus),
  `health-reviewer` (opus), `education-reviewer` (opus)
- Every agent has standardised frontmatter (`name`,
  `description`, `tools`, `model`) and the principal-level body
  shape: identity + mission, global rules enforced, auto-fire
  triggers, decision authority, review checklist, standards
  cited, output template, anti-patterns, pairing model,
  escalation triggers

#### Phase 7 — Council protocol overhaul

- 16-division structure (5 core always engage; 11 extended
  auto-fire per `council-triggers.md`)
- Bypass surfaces eliminated — `*` prefix only skips
  prompt-improver clarification; Council still convenes
- "Quick Council Check" deleted; "Abbreviated Council Check"
  preserves division participation with terser output
- Tiebreaker matrix codified — Architecture casting vote,
  Security / Compliance / Ethics / Risk vetoes named
- Bypass attempts logged to `~/.claude/audits/bypass-log.jsonl`
- New rule files: `council-default.md`, `council-triggers.md`
- Coverage target standardised at 80% project / 90% touched
- Rollback Protocol + Deprecation Lifecycle sections added

#### Phase 8 — Workspace ripple

- Workspace `CLAUDE.md` references updated for consolidated rule
  names (`no-discards.md` umbrella replaces older sibling
  references)
- Workspace plan + memory files relocated per
  `project-scoped-artifacts.md`

#### Phase 9 — Verification

- Synthetic Council task (multi-tenant rate-limiting) end-to-end
  pass
- Link-integrity grep, no-orphans, standards-citations checks
  green
- `bootstrap/verify.sh` reports 17 / 17 checks passing

#### Phase 10 — Final cleanup

- Stub redirects retired once references migrated
- Final link-check pass

#### Phase 11 — Project-scoped artifacts

- New rule `project-scoped-artifacts.md` — first-touch detection
  and workspace `.claude/` scaffold
- New template `templates/project-claude-scaffold/` shipped
- Tech-stack auto-detection table (Node / Go / Python / Ruby /
  Rust / Java / Kotlin / .NET / Swift / Dart / Solidity / IaC)

#### Phase 12.5 — Verify-before-claim + local-testability

- New rule `verify-before-claim.md` — every completion claim
  paired with same-turn verification block
- New rule `local-testability.md` — every code change locally
  testable BEFORE writing; missing prereqs surface env-setup
  request first

#### Phase 13 — External skill inventory

- Curated import from `anthropics/skills`,
  `claude-cookbooks`, `awesome-claude-code`,
  `VoltAgent/awesome-agent-skills`, `alirezarezvani/claude-skills`,
  `wshobson/agents`, claudemarketplaces.com
- Every imported skill normalised to the principal-level
  template + license + publisher allowlist check

#### Phase 14 — Public-repo packaging

- `README.md` — landing + 5-paragraph Council pitch +
  with-vs-without table
- `INSTALL.md` — macOS / Linux / Windows-native (PowerShell, no
  WSL2 required) / WSL2 sections; per-IDE walkthroughs
- `LICENSE` — MIT
- `bootstrap/install.sh` + `verify.sh` + `uninstall.sh`
  (POSIX shell)
- `bootstrap/install.ps1` + `verify.ps1` + `uninstall.ps1`
  (PowerShell 5.1+ / PowerShell Core 7+)
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/COUNCIL.md`, `docs/RULES.md`,
  `docs/SKILLS.md`, `docs/AGENTS.md`, `docs/PROJECT-BOOTSTRAP.md`,
  `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md`
- `tests/verify-link-integrity.sh`, `verify-no-orphans.sh`,
  `verify-standards-citations.sh`
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — runs all three verifiers on push
  and pull request
- `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` + `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`

#### Phase 15 — Per-IDE templates

- `templates/ide-configs/vscode/settings.json` +
  `extensions.json` — security-hardened defaults, allowlisted
  publishers, strict SonarLint thresholds
- `templates/ide-configs/cursor/settings.json` — VS Code-engine
  parity plus `cursor.*` governance (Pyright, Cmd-K, Composer,
  Tab, Privacy Mode, Background Agent)
- `templates/ide-configs/windsurf/settings.json` +
  `extensions.json` — Windsurf parity
- `templates/ide-configs/jetbrains/README.md` — Anthropic
  Claude Code [Beta] plugin install + per-IDE keymap +
  code-style XML pointers
- **Gem extensions added across all VS Code-engine templates**:
  Error Lens (inline diagnostics), Todo Tree (BANNED-marker
  surface — TODO/FIXME/XXX highlighted bright red), cSpell
  (typo catch in code + docs), `problems.sortOrder: severity`,
  `yaml.schemas` (GitHub Actions / docker-compose / Kubernetes /
  Dependabot / Renovate / pre-commit auto-validation),
  `files.associations` (dotenv, Containerfile, tfvars, etc.)

#### Phase 16 — Continuous-learning mandate

- New rule `continuous-learning-mandate.md` — every
  Council-mediated task emits a learning candidate;
  cross-project patterns promote to global; contradicted rules
  flag for refresh
- Every rule + skill + agent acquired a `learning_hooks`
  section
- `/learn`, `/learn-eval`, `/evolve`, `/instinct-export`,
  `/instinct-import`, `/instinct-status` operator commands

#### Phase 17 — Workspace consistency

- Every workspace `.claude/` aligned to the scaffold template
  shape (`rules/`, `skills/`, `agents/`, `plans/`, `memory/`,
  `audits/`)
- Project-specific plans + memories landed in their owning
  workspace

### Changed

- Default agent model for coding / reviewing / planning agents
  is `opus` (per user preference + multi-stack quality bar)
- Touched-file coverage minimum raised to ≥ 90% (project ≥ 80%)
  per `extreme-lint-policy.md`
- Cognitive-complexity cap tightened to 10 (was 15 default)
- Function-lines cap tightened to 80 (was 200 default)
- Function-parameter cap tightened to 5 (was 7 default)
- File-lines cap tightened to 500 (was 1000 default)
- Cross-IDE settings: AWS credentials use macOS Keychain via
  `aws-vault` — no long-term keys on disk

### Removed

- `continuous-learning` v1 (superseded by v2)
- Hardcoded workspace / vendor / personal-project tokens from
  every global file
- Per-line lint suppressions across the entire global tree
- Stale plan files from `~/.claude/plans/` (relocated to
  workspaces or archived)
- Empty `session-env/*/` subdirectories; stale `ide/*.lock`
  files; `cache/changelog.md`; root `.DS_Store`,
  `.last-cleanup`, `stats-cache.json`, `mcp-needs-auth-cache.json`

### Fixed

- `bootstrap/verify.sh` Phase G silent-abort (hardcoded
  workspace tokens + `set -euo pipefail` propagating
  `grep`'s no-match exit) — replaced with the gitignored
  `.local/project-tokens` opt-in pattern + `set +e` guard
- VS Code drift items 1–13 in the live config (workspace trust,
  extension governance, git safety, telemetry, task safety,
  format-on-save, MCP gateway lockdown)
- Cursor settings parity with VS Code plus `cursor.*` governance

### Security

- Hook-enforced `no-discards`: discards, suppression directives,
  hardcoded credentials, weak crypto, raw `console.log`,
  merge-conflict markers rejected at edit time
- `dependency-vulnerabilities.md` CVE gate (MODERATE+ blocks)
- `license-allowlist-gate.md` SPDX allowlist + Trove
  cross-check
- `security-controls-org-wide.md` 5-layer non-bypassable
  enforcement pattern
- `secrets-management.md` — vault-first, never on disk in
  cleartext, atomic rotation, scrub-after-rotate
- `install-allowlist.md` — publisher allowlist for npm / VS
  Code / Cursor / MCP / Homebrew taps
- `docker-localhost-binding.md` — every host port `127.0.0.1:`
  prefixed on dev machines
