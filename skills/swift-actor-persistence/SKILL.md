# Swift Actors for Thread-Safe Persistence

Patterns for building thread-safe data persistence layers using Swift actors. Combines in-memory
caching with file-backed storage, leveraging the actor model to eliminate data races at compile
time.

## When to Activate

- Building a data persistence layer in Swift 5.5+
- Need thread-safe access to shared mutable state
- Want to eliminate manual synchronization (locks, DispatchQueues)
- Building offline-first apps with local storage

## Purpose

Principal-level Swift concurrency + persistence: `actor` for thread-safe shared state, `Sendable`
conformance, structured concurrency via `async`/`await` + `TaskGroup`, persistence via Core Data /
SwiftData / SQLite under actor isolation, cancellation propagation.

**Negative scope** (NOT what this skill covers):

- Generic Swift idioms — see `coding-quality-rules`
- Protocol-based DI + test doubles — see `swift-protocol-di-testing`
- iOS-specific UI patterns — out of scope here
- Cross-platform Swift Server (Vapor) patterns — defer to project-specific

## Standards Cited

  **SE-0401 (Remove preconcurrency)** — formal specs
- **WWDC 2021–2024 Concurrency sessions** — Apple's canonical guidance
- **Core Data Reference** + **SwiftData Reference** — persistence APIs
- **Effective Swift** (community-canonical patterns)
- **OWASP Mobile Top 10 M2 (Insecure Data Storage)** — persistence security
- **Compliance mapping** (`references/concurrency-standards.md`): ISO/IEC 25010:2011,

  CWE Top 25, SLSA Framework v1.0

## When NOT to use

- Single-threaded scripts (actor overhead unnecessary)
- Read-only configuration (use immutable struct)
- Legacy Objective-C-bridged code that can't adopt Sendable

| **Swift security**: Keychain, App Transport Security, input validation, biometric auth | [`references/security.md`](references/security.md) |

## Migrated rules (rules-library/swift/, 2026-06-02)

Phase H will delete the source files at `rules-library/swift/`. Content below preserves the original
rule bodies for lazy-load via the `paths:` glob above.

Those rule bodies now live in `references/` — the routing table above names the file for each.
