## Purpose

Structural engineering is the discipline that ensures
buildings, bridges, towers, and other constructed assets
resist gravity, wind, seismic, snow, and use loads without
collapsing, deforming excessively, or vibrating
uncomfortably — and continue doing so for their intended
service life.

This skill provides principal-level literacy in the
structural disciplines without claiming to design structures.
The audience is: project managers running construction,
architects collaborating with SEORs, software engineers
working on BIM / structural-analysis tooling, real estate
operators assessing capacity for tenant fit-out, sustainability
practitioners interrogating embodied carbon, and anyone making
decisions that touch loads + structure.

This skill explicitly does NOT replace a licensed Structural
Engineer of Record (SEOR). Any actual structural design,
analysis, or modification requires a licensed PE / CEng /
equivalent who stamps the calcs and accepts professional
liability. The role of this skill is to make sure the
conversation between non-structural stakeholders and the
SEOR is informed and the right questions get asked at the
right time.

## When to Fire

This skill engages when work involves:

- Load path discussions (gravity, lateral, seismic, wind)
- Building structural systems (frames, walls, shells,
  membranes)
- Tenant fit-out feasibility (slab capacity, MEP penetrations
  through structure)
- Existing building due diligence + condition assessment
- Adaptive reuse / change of occupancy (which often triggers
  full structural upgrade)
- Seismic risk evaluation
- Vibration / serviceability concerns (floor vibration from
  HVAC, gym, MRI, sensitive equipment)
- Embodied carbon analysis of structures
- Construction phase issues — temporary works, shoring,
  formwork, sequencing
- Coordination with MEP (penetration locations, hung loads,
  vibration isolation) — see [[mep-coordination]]
- BIM / 3D-model interoperability with structural analysis
  software (Revit ↔ Tekla ↔ ETABS / SAP2000 / RAM /
  STAAD.Pro / Robot)
- Performance-based design discussions
- Forensic investigation / failure analysis
- Building information modelling (BIM) — LOD definitions
  affecting structural deliverables
- Permit + code review on a structural permit set
- Disputes between Architect / Owner / Contractor about
  structural responsibility

It does NOT engage for actual structural design work — that
requires a licensed SEOR with appropriate jurisdictional
authority.

## Anti-Patterns

### Treating the architect as the structural authority

An architect can sketch a feasible scheme, but only the SEOR
can confirm it. When the architect promises an unsupported
column-removed scheme to the owner, then asks the SEOR to
"make it work," the project takes the rework cost. Engage
the SEOR before promising structural feasibility.

### "We have the drawings, so we know the structure"

Original drawings often diverge from as-built reality (field
changes, undocumented modifications, deterioration).
Condition assessment is mandatory before relying on archived
drawings for capacity / modification work.

### Skipping the geotechnical investigation

"We'll just use standard footings." Soil conditions vary
hugely site-to-site; bad soil + standard footings produces
differential settlement, structural cracking, and expensive
remediation.

### Ignoring serviceability

Floor vibration, drift, deflection — these aren't safety
issues but are tenant-experience issues that surface 6-24
months after occupancy. Specify the use case (sensitive
equipment, gym, residential) early so the SEOR designs to
the right serviceability target.

### "Just add stiffness"

Adding stiffness changes natural frequency, attracts more
seismic load, and may make the problem worse. Damping is
often the right intervention. Vibration consultants are a
specialty practice.

### Penetrations through structural elements

Cutting through beams, columns, shear walls, or post-tension
slabs is a structural modification requiring SEOR review +
calc + repair detail. Routine MEP / tenant fit-out can
accidentally violate this (see [[mep-coordination]]).

### Buy-American + sole sourcing failures

Specifying a single supplier for a critical element (special
seismic detail, fabrication-intensive component) without
backup creates schedule + supply-chain risk. Build redundancy
into the supplier base.

### Performance-based design without rigour

"Performance-based" must mean explicit objectives,
peer-reviewed analysis, and acceptance by the Authority
Having Jurisdiction (AHJ). PBD applied without rigour is
worse than code-minimum.

### Disregarding existing-building code paths

Adaptive reuse projects often discover that they trigger
seismic upgrade requirements they hadn't budgeted. Engage the
SEOR + AHJ early to map the code path (Chapter 34 IEBC vs
Chapter 8 IBC, etc.).

### Software model = structural reality

The Revit / BIM model isn't the structural calc. Members
shown in BIM may differ from analyzed members; connections
shown in BIM may be approximate. Always defer to stamped
structural calcs + drawings for code review.

## Verification Checklist

For a project involving structural decisions:

- [ ] SEOR is identified, licensed in jurisdiction, and
      engaged per scope.
- [ ] Risk Category + Importance Factor set per occupancy
      class.
- [ ] Geotechnical report dated + suitable for site + scope.
- [ ] Loads per current code, including site-specific seismic
      + wind.
- [ ] Load combinations per ASCE 7 / Eurocode + LRFD or ASD
      consistent throughout.
- [ ] Load path documented + continuous for gravity + lateral
      + seismic.
- [ ] Lateral system selected with appropriate R + detailing
      requirements.
- [ ] Serviceability targets identified (deflection,
      vibration, drift).
- [ ] Foundation type matches geotechnical recommendations.
- [ ] Existing building: condition assessment, code path,
      retrofit / upgrade scope agreed.
- [ ] MEP coordination: penetrations, hung loads, vibration
      isolation accounted for.
- [ ] Embodied carbon assessment if sustainability target
      applies.
- [ ] Construction sequencing reviewed for shoring + temporary
      works.
- [ ] Permit + AHJ review path identified.
- [ ] Peer review / SER engaged if performance-based design or
      complex project.

## Why This Skill Exists

Structural failures are rare but catastrophic. The visible
historical examples — Champlain Towers South (Surfside FL
2021, 98 dead), Hard Rock Hotel (New Orleans 2019, 3 dead),
Plasco Building (Tehran 2017, 26 dead), Hyatt Regency walkway
(Kansas City 1981, 114 dead), Ronan Point (London 1968, 4
dead, progressive collapse) — each reveal that codes,
inspection, peer review, and competent engineering all
matter.

Daily structural decisions are far smaller stakes:

- Can this slab carry an MRI room (3-5 tons concentrated
  load)?
- Can we remove this column to open the floor plate?
- Is this 1960s warehouse safe to convert to apartments?
- Does our datacenter floor support 6 kW/rack PDU + dense
  storage?

Each requires structural literacy at the decision-making
level + a licensed SEOR for the actual call. This skill exists
to make non-structural stakeholders capable participants in
the conversation — asking the right questions, recognising the
load path, understanding when an SEOR opinion is needed,
acknowledging when an SEOR's "no" is final.

The cost of getting it wrong scales from "ugly cracks" through
"unusable building" to "people die." The cost of asking the
SEOR earlier rather than later is minor by comparison.

## Learning hooks

Per `~/.claude/rules/common/continuous-learning-mandate.md`:

**Signals to watch**:

- Load path not explicitly verified end-to-end (gravity + lateral)
- Soft-storey detected in lateral system without remediation
- Diaphragm rigidity assumption used where actual behaviour is flexible
- Seismic detailing skipped because "site is low seismicity" (without code verification)
- Tolerance stack-up unmodelled (member fits assume zero variance)
- Hold-down / anchor design omitted on light-frame seismic projects
- Long-span deflection criteria misapplied (live-load vs total)
- Vibration / serviceability check absent on long-span floors
- Connection design deferred to fabricator without spec
- Existing structure modification without forensic assessment of as-built

**Refinement candidates**:

- New code-edition row when Eurocode / AISC / ACI ships major update
- New cross-reference when a sister skill (mep-coordination) adds a structural gate
- New connection-template row when a recurring detail emerges
- Tightening of the SEOR-consult policy when judgment calls recur
