## Purpose

Organisational design is the conscious construction of team
boundaries, reporting lines, decision rights, and coordination
mechanisms so the work that matters can happen with low
coordination cost. Good org design produces teams that ship
fast, decisions that are clear, and a product whose internal
structure matches its external surface. Bad org design produces
endless cross-team dependencies, decision paralysis, and a
product whose seams reveal the political compromises of the
people who built it.

This skill names the canonical structures (functional,
divisional, matrix, network, holacracy), the team topologies
that work at scale (Team Topologies — stream-aligned, platform,
enabling, complicated-subsystem), the decision-rights frameworks
(DACI, RACI, RAPID), the span-of-control discipline, the
coordination-cost math (Brooks's Law), the operational patterns
(operating rhythms, planning cadences, escalation paths), and
the discipline that lets the org evolve with the product
without rewriting itself every time something interesting
happens.

NOT in scope: individual people management (see
`performance-management`); hiring (see `hiring-process`); goal
setting (see `okr-framework`); compensation and equity bands;
HR compliance.

## When to Fire

- Founding or restructuring a team / function / company
- Annual / quarterly planning where org gaps surface
- Recurring complaint: "every change requires three teams to
  coordinate"
- Slow time-to-decision; escalations stuck above the appropriate
  level
- Hiring plan: where do new roles report?
- M&A integration
- Crossing a Dunbar threshold (10 → 50 → 150 → 500 → 1500)
- New product line or business unit
- Shift in strategy that current structure can't deliver

Pairs with `okr-framework` (cascade follows reporting lines),
`hiring-process` (org gaps define hiring), `performance-management`
(career ladders match structure), `documentation-requirements.md`
(CODEOWNERS + RACI live in docs), `task-intake-due-diligence.md`
Q26 (operational handoff), `code-of-conduct.md` (org-wide
norms).

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-pattern | Why bad | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Org chart copies competitor's | Competitor's structure was for their strategy, not yours | Design structure from strategy |
| Reorgs as response to performance | Performance issues are usually about goals + feedback + clarity, not structure | Diagnose first |
| Two-boss matrix without decision rights | Deadlock | DACI / RACI for every recurring decision class |
| Span of control > 9 for knowledge work | Mentorship fails | Restructure |
| Span < 3 | Hierarchy redundancy | Flatten |
| Senior IC promoted to manager keeps doing IC | Reports unmanaged | Hire managers separately; protect the IC track |
| Platform team without consumer voice | Builds the wrong thing | Treat consumers as customers; quarterly research |
| Reorgs every six months | Disruption cost dwarfs structural gains | Stable horizons; change in 18-24 month rhythms |
| Acquired team integrated dissolution | Loses what was acquired | Define autonomy + integration boundary |
| "Cross-functional team" with no decision authority | Theatre | Either give the team the decision OR don't pretend |
| Org chart doesn't match codeowners | Reality drifts from declared structure | CODEOWNERS as the truth; reconcile quarterly |
| Promotion to manager as reward | Performance suffers for everyone | Parallel IC track at every level |
| 200-person all-hands as decision forum | Dunbar broken | Use cascading communication; decisions in smaller forums |

## Why This Skill Exists

Every product company's org chart is a hypothesis about how to
build the product. The hypothesis is rarely tested explicitly —
it's drawn on the back of a napkin during a founding meeting,
preserved as the team grows, and slowly diverges from what
would actually work today. By the time the symptoms surface
(slow decisions, endless cross-team dependencies, frustration
from people who feel they've never been managed), the
disruption cost of fixing the structure feels prohibitive, so
it doesn't get fixed; instead, the symptoms become the culture.

The discipline this skill describes — naming team topologies,
honouring span of control, documenting decision rights, sizing
teams to Dunbar's rings, maintaining operating rhythm, treating
career ladders as structural artefacts, picking modes
intentionally — is what separates organisations that grow their
capability with their headcount from organisations whose
headcount grows while their delivery slows. None of the
patterns are exotic; they are the converged learning of a
century of organisational research, applied to the
human-coordination problem of building software at scale.

The cost: thoughtful structural decisions take time, and
reorgs cost morale; doing them well requires resisting the
temptation to react to every quarter's friction. The benefit:
teams that ship without permission, decisions that close,
careers that progress, products whose architecture matches their
strategy, and an organisation that scales because the
coordination cost is bounded.

## Learning hooks

Per `~/.claude/rules/common/continuous-learning-mandate.md`:

**Signals to watch**:

- Manager span > 10 reports without enabling-team support (span-of-control weakening)
- Conway's Law mismatch: org chart inverted vs system architecture
- Team boundaries cut across value streams (cross-team coordination tax)
- Decision rights ambiguous (RACI / DACI absent on cross-cutting initiatives)
- Reorg announced without transition plan (productivity crater)
- Reporting structure changed without role-clarity update (career-path uncertainty)
- Platform / enabling teams understaffed relative to stream-aligned teams
- Bus factor < 2 on critical systems (knowledge SPOF)
- Career ladder ratings calibrated inconsistently across teams
- Onboarding time-to-productivity unmeasured

**Refinement candidates**:

- New team-topology row when a new pattern proves out (Team Topologies revisions)
- New cross-reference when a sister skill (hiring-process, performance-management, okr-framework)
  adds an org gate
- New transition-plan template when reorg-fatigue recurs
- Tightening of the bus-factor minimum when SPOF incident recurs
