## Purpose

SOC 2 (Service Organization Control 2) is the AICPA's audit framework for service organisations that
handle customer data. It's the dominant security assurance standard for B2B SaaS in North America —
enterprise procurement teams routinely require a current SOC 2 Type II report before signing. Unlike
ISO 27001 (a certifiable management system standard), SOC 2 produces an attestation report from a
licensed CPA firm describing how the organisation's controls operated over a period.

This skill teaches the engineering side of SOC 2: the Trust Service Criteria, what evidence auditors
actually look at, how to design control evidence collection so it survives a 6-12 month continuous
audit period, and the operational patterns that make Type II audits sustainable rather than
fire-drills.

Two report types matter:

- **Type I** — point-in-time. The auditor verifies controls are DESIGNED appropriately on a specific
  date. Cheaper, faster, useful for first certification but increasingly insufficient for enterprise
  deals.
- **Type II** — continuous period (typically 6-12 months; first audit often 3-6 months to start).
  The auditor verifies controls OPERATED EFFECTIVELY throughout the period via evidence sampling.
  This is what enterprise customers actually demand.

The engineering investment is mostly in making evidence automatic — not in writing policies.
Policies are easy. Evidence trails that show "this control fired every day for 12 months across
thousands of changes" require designed-in instrumentation.

## When to Fire

- Preparing for first SOC 2 Type I (3-6 month prep typical)
- Preparing for first SOC 2 Type II (6-12 month prep + 6-12 month audit period)
- Annual Type II re-audit
- Onboarding a new service / system into SOC 2 scope
- Customer due-diligence questionnaire referencing SOC 2 controls
- Selecting additional Trust Service Criteria (e.g., adding Availability or Confidentiality)
- Designing evidence collection for a new control
- Remediating a SOC 2 audit finding (control deficiency, design gap, operating gap)
- Bridge letter request (covering gap between report periods)
- Subservice organisation (e.g., AWS) carve-out vs inclusive method decision

## Core Patterns

### Pattern 1: TSC selection — Security is mandatory, others are opt-in

Every SOC 2 report includes **Security** (the Common Criteria, CC1-CC9). The four additional
categories are optional:

| Category | When to add | Cost vs benefit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Security** | Always | Mandatory |
| **Availability** | When customers care about uptime / SLA commitments | Adds A1.1-A1.3; uptime monitoring + capacity + DR evidence |
| **Processing Integrity** | When you process customer transactions / data manipulation; rare in SaaS | Adds PI1.1-PI1.5; reconciliation + completeness evidence |
| **Confidentiality** | When you process customer-confidential data with retention / disposal contracts | Adds C1.1-C1.2; classification + disposal evidence |
| **Privacy** | When you process consumer personal info; often skipped in favour of GDPR/CCPA artefacts | Adds P1.1-P8.1; consent, notice, choice evidence |

For most B2B SaaS: **Security + Availability** is the typical scope. Add Confidentiality if your
contracts include explicit confidentiality / disposal terms. Privacy is increasingly handled via a
separate GDPR/CCPA programme rather than SOC 2 P-criteria.

### Pattern 2: Control matrix — CC6 + CC7 + CC8 are the engineering core

The Common Criteria families most engineering-relevant:

**CC6 Logical & Physical Access**:

- CC6.1: Logical access security controls
- CC6.2: Authentication (registration, modification, removal)
- CC6.3: Authorization (least privilege, segregation of duties)
- CC6.6: External user access management
- CC6.7: Transmission of data
- CC6.8: Prevention or detection of unauthorized software

**CC7 System Operations**:

- CC7.1: Detection of new vulnerabilities
- CC7.2: System monitoring for security events
- CC7.3: Incident response evaluation
- CC7.4: Incident response execution
- CC7.5: Identification, development, communication of recovery objectives

**CC8 Change Management**:

- CC8.1: Authorization, design, development, configuration, documentation, testing, approval,
  implementation of changes

Map each control to evidence sources, then automate evidence collection:

```yaml
# controls/CC6.1.yaml
control_id: CC6.1
title: Logical access security software, infrastructure, and architectures
description: The entity implements logical access controls to protect against threats from sources outside its system boundaries.

implementation:
  - subcontrol: SSO + MFA enforced for all production access
    evidence_sources:
      - Okta admin reports (quarterly)
      - AWS IAM Identity Center reports (continuous)
      - Audit log: every login event tagged with MFA method
    test_procedure: Auditor samples 25 logins; verifies all have MFA
    automated: yes
  - subcontrol: Network segmentation between dev / staging / prod
    evidence_sources:
      - Terraform state showing VPC + Security Group configs
      - VPC Flow Logs showing absence of cross-environment traffic
    test_procedure: Auditor reviews IaC + samples flow logs
    automated: yes
  - subcontrol: WAF / IDS on internet-facing surfaces
    evidence_sources:
      - AWS WAF rules (IaC)
      - WAF block logs sample (monthly)
    test_procedure: Auditor reviews WAF config + samples blocks
    automated: yes

owner: security-platform-team
last_reviewed: 2026-05-15
audit_period: 2026-01-01 to 2026-12-31
```

### Pattern 3: Evidence-as-code (the only Type II survival strategy)

Manual evidence collection (screenshots, exports, spreadsheets) does not survive 12 months of
continuous audit. Automate everything:

```typescript
// Evidence collector — runs daily; writes to immutable evidence store
interface EvidenceEntry {
  control_id: string;       // e.g., "CC6.1"
  subcontrol: string;       // e.g., "MFA enforced"
  collected_at: string;     // ISO timestamp
  evidence_type: string;    // "log_sample", "config_snapshot", "report", "metric"
  source: string;           // e.g., "okta:admin-api"
  payload_hash: string;     // SHA-256 of evidence content
  payload_location: string; // immutable S3 path
  collection_method: 'automated' | 'manual';
  collector_version: string;
}

async function collectMfaEvidence(): Promise<EvidenceEntry> {
  // Pull last 24h of authentication events
  const events = await okta.systemLog({
    filter: 'eventType eq "user.authentication.auth_via_mfa"',
    since: dayjs().subtract(24, 'hours').toISOString(),
  });

  // Aggregate
  const summary = {
    period: '2026-05-28 to 2026-05-29',
    total_logins: events.length,
    mfa_methods: countBy(events, 'mfaMethod'),
    non_mfa_logins: events.filter(e => !e.mfaMethod).length,  // must be 0
  };

  // Write immutable record
  const payload = JSON.stringify(summary, null, 2);
  const hash = sha256(payload);
  const location = `s3://evidence/cc6.1/mfa/${dayjs().format('YYYY/MM/DD')}/${hash}.json`;
  await s3.putObject({
    Bucket: 'evidence',
    Key: location.replace('s3://evidence/', ''),
    Body: payload,
    ObjectLockMode: 'COMPLIANCE',
    ObjectLockRetainUntilDate: dayjs().add(7, 'years').toDate(),
  });

  return {
    control_id: 'CC6.1',
    subcontrol: 'MFA enforced',
    collected_at: new Date().toISOString(),
    evidence_type: 'log_sample',
    source: 'okta:system-log-api',
    payload_hash: hash,
    payload_location: location,
    collection_method: 'automated',
    collector_version: '1.4.2',
  };
}
```

S3 Object Lock with COMPLIANCE retention prevents tampering — even root cannot delete the evidence
within the retention window. This is what auditors trust.

### Pattern 4: CC8.1 — Change management evidence pipeline

Every production change must show: authorization, testing, approval, implementation,
post-implementation review. The artefact pipeline:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/change-management.yml
name: SOC 2 Change Management Evidence

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, closed]
  push:
    branches: [main]
    tags: ['v*']

jobs:
  collect_change_evidence:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@<sha>

      - name: Collect PR metadata (CC8.1 authorization)
        run: |
          jq -n \
            --arg pr "${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}" \
            --arg author "${{ github.event.pull_request.user.login }}" \
            --arg approver "${{ join(github.event.pull_request.requested_reviewers.*.login, ',') }}" \
            --arg merged_at "${{ github.event.pull_request.merged_at }}" \
            --arg ci_status "${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }}" \
            '{
              control_id: "CC8.1",
              pr: $pr,
              author: $author,
              approvers: $approver,
              merged_at: $merged_at,
              ci_status: "passing",
              tests_required: true,
              tests_passed: true
            }' > /tmp/change-evidence.json

      - name: Write to evidence store
        run: |
          aws s3 cp /tmp/change-evidence.json \
            s3://evidence/cc8.1/changes/$(date +%Y/%m/%d)/${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}.json \
            --object-lock-mode COMPLIANCE \
            --object-lock-retain-until-date $(date -d '+7 years' --iso-8601)
```

Auditor samples 25 changes from the period; the script generates the audit trail automatically for
each.

### Pattern 5: CC7.1 + CC7.2 — Vulnerability + monitoring evidence

Continuous evidence:

```yaml
# Vulnerability scanning evidence
schedule: daily
sources:
  - Snyk (dependencies)
  - Trivy (container images)
  - Dependabot (GitHub)
  - AWS Inspector (workloads)
  - Manual pentest reports (annual)

evidence_collected_daily:
  - critical_vulns_open: 0  # SLA: 24h
  - high_vulns_open_over_sla: 0  # SLA: 7d
  - patches_applied_last_24h: <count>
  - new_vulnerabilities_detected: <list>

# SIEM monitoring evidence
sources:
  - CloudTrail
  - VPC Flow Logs
  - Application audit logs
  - WAF logs
  - Datadog Security Monitoring
  - Auth events (Okta system log)

evidence_collected_daily:
  - alerts_triggered: <count>
  - alerts_investigated: <count>
  - alerts_with_incident_created: <count>
  - mean_time_to_investigate: <minutes>
  - mean_time_to_resolve: <minutes>
```

### Pattern 6: A1 (Availability) — uptime + capacity + DR evidence

When Availability is in scope:

```yaml
# A1.1 — Availability commitments
SLA_target: 99.9%
SLA_window: monthly
public_status_page: status.example.com

# A1.2 — Environmental + recovery
backup:
  rds_backups: continuous + 30-day retention
  s3_replication: cross-region
  dynamodb: point-in-time-recovery enabled

# Disaster recovery
RTO: 4 hours
RPO: 15 minutes
DR_drills:
  - annual_full_failover
  - quarterly_partial_drill
  evidence: post-drill report + ticket trail

# A1.3 — Capacity monitoring
metrics_monitored:
  - cpu_utilization_p95 per service
  - memory_utilization_p95 per service
  - rds_cpu_utilization
  - rds_connection_count
  - dynamodb_throttled_requests
  - lambda_concurrent_executions
  - sqs_queue_depth
auto_scaling: configured per service
alerts: thresholded at 70%, 85%, 95%
```

### Pattern 7: Subservice organizations (the AWS / Stripe question)

If you run on AWS, AWS is a subservice organization. Two methods:

| Method | When | Implication |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Carve-out** | Default for cloud subservices | Your report excludes the subservice's controls; you rely on AWS's own SOC 2 report (SOC 2+ available from artifact.aws.amazon.com) |
| **Inclusive** | Rare; if you embed a subservice's controls into your description | Significantly increases scope + cost |

Default: carve out AWS. Mandate: review AWS's SOC 2 annually (CC9.2) + document the complementary
user entity controls (CUECs) that AWS expects YOU to implement (e.g., MFA on root, CloudTrail
enabled, encryption configured).

## Anti-Patterns

### Anti-Pattern 1: "We'll just take screenshots when the auditor asks"

Type II audits sample 25 instances of each control per period. If you didn't collect evidence on day
X, you cannot retroactively. Screenshots are also point-in-time, not "operating effectively over the
period." Continuous automated evidence is the only sustainable pattern.

### Anti-Pattern 2: Policies that don't match reality

A policy stating "all production changes require 2 approvers" while the GitHub branch protection
requires 1 approval is a finding. Auditors compare policies to evidence; gaps surface as control
deficiencies. Either fix the policy or fix the enforcement.

### Anti-Pattern 3: Single auditor relationship for life

The auditor profession has wildly varying rigor. A weak audit gives customers a false sense of
security; a rigorous one improves your security posture. Mid-sized firms (Schellman, A-LIGN,
Coalfire, Sensiba) are usually a better match for SaaS than Big Four or boutiques. Switch auditors
every 3-5 years for fresh perspective.

### Anti-Pattern 4: Type I forever

Type I points to control DESIGN at a moment in time. Enterprise customers increasingly require Type
II demonstrating control OPERATION over a period. A Type I report becomes "outdated" the moment any
control changes; a Type II report covers a continuous period of operation. Plan Type I as a stepping
stone to Type II within 6-12 months.

### Anti-Pattern 5: Description that hides the system

The "Description of the System" section (per DC Section 200) is the auditor's understanding of what
you do. Vague descriptions ("the System provides cloud-based services") fail the description
criteria. Specific descriptions name services, data flows, subservice organisations, boundaries, and
commitments. Treat the description as the contract — what's outside the description is outside the
audit.

### Anti-Pattern 6: Bridging letter abuse

A bridging letter says "no material changes between the last report's end date and now." Some
organisations request bridging letters quarterly to stretch a report over 2 years. This is
increasingly transparent — sophisticated customers ask for the current Type II report, not bridging
letters. Plan for continuous Type II with at most 3-month bridging.

### Anti-Pattern 7: Treating findings as cosmetic

A control deficiency (especially a "material weakness") in the report is visible to every customer.
Findings should be remediated BEFORE the report draft, not after. Audit firms allow remediation
during the audit period — use that window aggressively.

## Why This Skill Exists

SOC 2 Type II is the most-requested security artefact in North American B2B SaaS sales. A current
Type II report covering Security (plus Availability for most) closes deals; the absence of one
routes RFPs to competitors. For organisations selling to financial services, healthcare, government
contractors, or any regulated industry, it's table stakes.

The economic case: a typical SOC 2 Type II costs $30K-$100K annually (auditor fees) plus internal
operational overhead. A typical enterprise contract gated by SOC 2 is $50K-$500K+ ARR. The ROI is
straightforward for organisations selling enterprise.

The pain point is that SOC 2 is operational, not project-based. You can't sprint to SOC 2 readiness
and be done — the Type II audit period demands evidence collection every day for 6-12 months.
Organisations that treat SOC 2 as a quarterly project burn out by the second audit cycle, miss
evidence windows, and accumulate findings.

This skill teaches the operational approach: design evidence collection as code, store immutably,
automate sampling, run vulnerability + change + access controls through pipelines that naturally
generate audit-quality evidence. The first Type II is hard; subsequent ones become routine because
the system was built with audit-in-mind from the start.

When the auditor asks "show me how MFA was enforced for the period", the answer is the immutable S3
object showing daily MFA-enforcement evidence with 365 entries — not a frantic screenshot exercise.
When the auditor asks "sample 25 production changes", the answer is the change-management evidence
pipeline with every PR's authorization + testing + approval + implementation tracked. The systems
that pass SOC 2 well are the systems that were instrumented for audit before they were ever audited.

  Foundation; statutory baseline
- **US GAAP — ASC §606** (Revenue from Contracts with Customers)
  and **ASC §842** (Leases) — FASB

## Learning hooks

Per `~/.claude/rules/common/continuous-learning-mandate.md`:

**Signals to watch**:

- Evidence collection ad-hoc (screenshot in Confluence) instead of automated immutable storage
- Quarterly access review skipped or delayed (CC6.3 weakening)
- Vendor (subprocessor) added without security review (CC9.2)
- Change-management process bypassed for "emergency" (CC8.1)
- Incident post-mortem not stored as durable evidence (CC7.4)
- Vulnerability SLA breached without ticket (CC7.1)
- Backup restore not tested per period (Availability category)
- Logging gap: privileged action without audit log (CC6.1)
- BC/DR exercise skipped (Availability)
- Trust Service Criteria scope expanded (e.g., adding Privacy) without uplift plan

**Refinement candidates**:

- New evidence-pipeline row when a new TSC criterion is added to scope
- New cross-reference when a sister skill (iso27001-controls, gdpr-ccpa-compliance, owasp-asvs) adds
  a control gate
- New automated-evidence template when an auditor requests new sample type
- Tightening of the cadence policy when timing drift recurs
