## Purpose

Communication is the discipline of getting an idea from your head
into somebody else's head with high enough fidelity that they can
act on it. Engineering work is judged largely on whether other
people understand it; the most brilliant technical insight that
nobody can decode produces no value.

Most people communicate badly because they write or speak from
their own perspective: they convey what they want to say, in the
order they thought of it, in the structure that makes sense to
them. Principal-level communication is structurally different: it
starts from the **audience** (what do they know, what do they
need, what do they care about), structures the message in **answer-
first** form (Pyramid Principle: governing thought + supporting
arguments), chooses the right **mode** for the audience + content
(written / verbal / visual / interactive), and edits ruthlessly so
the listener / reader hits the answer fast.

This skill provides:

1. The Pyramid Principle — answer-first writing + speaking
2. Audience analysis discipline
3. Mode selection (sync / async, written / verbal / visual)
4. Narrative + story structure (SCQA, Hero's Journey, Heath +
   Heath SUCCESs)
5. Executive presence + the senior-audience pattern
6. Written excellence (Bezos 6-pager, Strunk + White, Pinker)
7. Visual + presentation excellence (Duarte, Reynolds, Tufte)
8. Difficult conversations + Crucial Conversations methodology
9. Listening + the receive side of communication
10. Cross-cultural delivery + tone adaptation
11. Crisis + incident communication patterns
12. Anti-patterns + manipulation tactics to avoid

It does NOT cover the substance of what you communicate — that's
the domain of the underlying skill (negotiation, design,
strategy). Communication is the delivery.
