## Purpose

Research is the disciplined production of new knowledge or
verified evidence that supports a decision. It sits between
"opinion" and "data": opinions are unsupported beliefs;
research is belief with explicit grounding in evidence,
methodology, and source citation.

Most people "research" by Googling for a few minutes, reading
2-3 articles, and assembling a position. Principal-level
research is structurally different: it begins with an explicit
**question**, distinguishes **primary** from **secondary**
sources, picks methods (quantitative / qualitative / mixed)
fit for the question, manages **bias**, **reproducibility**,
and **citation discipline**, and produces evidence that someone
else could re-derive or extend.

This skill provides:

1. The research question — what makes a good one
2. Primary vs secondary sources + the evidence hierarchy
3. Method selection: quantitative, qualitative, mixed
4. Literature review + systematic review methodology
5. Experimental design + causal inference patterns
6. Survey design (Dillman tailored design method)
7. Interview design + qualitative coding (Braun + Clarke
   thematic analysis, grounded theory)
8. Bias identification (selection, response, confirmation,
   publication, survivorship, recall)
9. Statistical inference + p-values + confidence intervals
   - effect sizes
10. Reproducibility + replicability + FAIR data
11. Citation + reference management discipline
12. Research ethics (IRB, informed consent, data privacy)

It does NOT cover the substance of any specific domain — that's
the role of domain skills. Research is the cross-cutting
discipline of how you know what you know.

[`references/anti-patterns.md`](references/anti-patterns.md): Google-Scholar
cherry pick · tertiary-source citation · correlation-as-causation ·
sample-size theatre · HARKing · p < 0.05 as truth · single-study salvation ·
expert-opinion as evidence · selection bias in user research · confirmation
bias · survivorship bias · researcher-as-activist · stale sources · citation
without reading · statistical conflated with practical significance.

## Learning hooks

Per `~/.claude/rules/common/continuous-learning-mandate.md`:

**Signals to watch**:

- Claims made without primary-source citation (secondary / tertiary substitution — evidence
  hierarchy weakening)
- Sample drawn without documented sampling frame (convenience sampling masquerading as
  representative)
- p-value cited without effect size + confidence interval (statistical-significance theatre)
- Qualitative research without coding rubric / inter-rater reliability (researcher-bias gateway)
- Literature review skipped before primary research (replication / prior-art waste)
- Pre-registration absent for confirmatory studies (HARKing — hypothesising after results known)
- FAIR principles ignored on data outputs (findable / accessible / interoperable / reusable gaps)
- Author / funder / institution conflicts of interest undisclosed

**Refinement candidates**:

- New method row when a recurring research class (e.g., A/B tests, user-interview studies, market
  sizing) needs codified protocol
- Update to evidence hierarchy when a domain (e.g., ML, behavioural econ, epidemiology) shifts what
  counts as gold-standard
- Bias-identification additions when a recurring blind spot surfaces in post-study reviews
- Reproducibility-template additions (notebook + data + code archive standards) as tooling evolves
