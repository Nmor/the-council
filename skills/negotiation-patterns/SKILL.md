## Purpose

Negotiation is the process by which parties with differing interests
reach agreements without resorting to dictation or warfare. Every
non-trivial professional decision — what to build, who to hire, who
gets credit, what a contract says, what a vendor charges, where the
data centre lives — passes through some form of negotiation.

Most people negotiate badly because they conflate negotiation with
**bargaining over a single number** (price). Principal-level
negotiation is structurally different: it identifies the underlying
**interests** behind stated positions, discovers value-creating
**tradeoffs** across multiple issues, sets explicit **walkaway
points** before entering the room, and uses **tactical empathy** to
keep counterparties engaged through difficult conversations.

This skill provides:

1. Interest-based (integrative) negotiation — the Harvard Method
2. BATNA / ZOPA / reservation value preparation discipline
3. The two dimensions: claiming value vs creating value
4. Multi-issue tradeoff design + scoring systems
5. Tactical empathy + the Chris Voss methodology
6. Anchoring + reciprocity + commitment + framing — and when each backfires
7. Cross-cultural negotiation patterns (Hofstede, Brett)
8. Negotiation ethics + what's never acceptable
9. Common manipulation tactics and how to neutralise them
10. Internal-vs-external negotiation differences

It is NOT a script for "winning" — at the principal level, the goal
is durable value-creating agreements that both sides perform on.

The rule that survives without opening a reference: know your BATNA and your
reservation value BEFORE the conversation, and never misrepresent a material
fact.
