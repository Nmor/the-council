description: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system design — chunking, embeddings, vector storage, hybrid retrieval, reranking, evaluation, grounding, and the RAG-vs-fine-tune-vs-long-context decision. Auto-fires when the work touches RAG pipelines, vector databases, embeddings, semantic search, document grounding, or knowledge-base-backed LLM applications.

## Purpose

RAG systems combine a retriever (finds relevant context from a corpus)
with a generator (an LLM that conditions its output on the retrieved
context). The promise: grounded answers backed by source citations,
without needing to fine-tune the model on the entire corpus. The
failure modes: irrelevant retrieval, lost-in-the-middle context, stale
embeddings, hallucinated citations, query drift, and unbounded cost.

This skill names the design decisions that determine whether a RAG
system answers "what is the latest revision of the refund policy?"
correctly every time, or hallucinates a plausible-sounding policy
that doesn't exist. The decisions span six layers: ingestion,
chunking, embedding, indexing, retrieval, and generation — plus the
seventh layer that ties them together: evaluation.

NOT in scope: classical IR keyword search alone (handled by Elastic
/ OpenSearch / Algolia patterns); fine-tuning the underlying model
(see `fine-tuning-workflows`); LLM prompt engineering for non-RAG
applications (see `prompt-engineering`).
