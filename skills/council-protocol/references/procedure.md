# Council Conversation Protocol

Use these detailed templates when the risk or requested depth warrants them.
Current `CLAUDE.md` and `council-default.md` govern: work in the main session by
default, use at most one justified helper, and skip irrelevant or already answered
questions. The optional phase templates below describe a full review;
they do not require exhaustive research, five speeches or fresh intake for every task.
Opening a plan or touching an ADR does not automatically activate this skill.

## Research questions for a full review

For a full review, investigate unresolved material questions. Phase 0
begins with the 29-question task intake from
`~/.claude/rules/common/task-intake-due-diligence.md` (Floor)
— this populates the prior-art / OSS-option / scalability /
integration / failure-mode / security / data-lifecycle /
compliance / accessibility / i18n / test-strategy /
observability / cost / rollback / deprecation / UX-writing /
docs / risk / success-criteria / monitoring / AI-ethics /
vendor-IP / handoff fields that the divisions then discuss in
Phase 1. Consult primary sources for unresolved or time-sensitive external contracts. Reuse valid evidence and existing intake; do not create artificial phase gates.

===============================================================

TASK: [Restate the user's request clearly]

---------------------------------------------------------------
TASK INTAKE (per `task-intake-due-diligence.md`)
---------------------------------------------------------------

29 questions. Compact-table form for medium tasks; per-question
subsections for large plans; abbreviated (Q1 + Q2 + Q27) for
trivial work. Output documented and durable — the intake lives
in the plan file (`~/.claude/plans/<slug>.md` or
`<project>/.claude/plans/`) and is not redone for the same task
across sessions.

PRIMARY-SOURCE RESEARCH (when an external contract is unresolved)
---------------------------------------------------------------

For an unresolved integration contract, establish the applicable provider behavior before implementing it:

- The review should cite applicable primary-source
  provider documentation URLs in this section.
- Resolve material uncertainty before relying on the integration contract.
- Identify the in-scope service tier; research other tiers only when they affect the decision.
- Record relevant evidence in the existing plan or repository documentation; refresh when the contract may have changed.

DOCUMENTATION REVIEWED (primary sources only — no Stack Overflow,
no npm README, no blog posts):

| Source | Canonical URL | Key Findings |
| ------ | ------------- | ------------ |
| Provider docs | [provider's own domain] | [auth model, scopes, rate limits, deprecations] |
| RFC | [datatracker.ietf.org URL] | [protocol invariants, e.g. RFC 4791 for CalDAV] |

```

## Implementation and verification

Only proceed to write code after:

- All 5 divisions have provided their analysis
- Deep research has been completed
- All relevant files have been examined
- API documentation has been reviewed (if applicable)
- Cloud services have been identified and justified
- Testing & QA has approved the test-first plan
- Consensus has been reached across all divisions
- GO decision has been made
- Any NO-GO concerns have been resolved with the user

**Implementation Order**:

1. **tdd-guide** writes tests first (Red phase)
2. **Implementation** writes code to pass tests (Green phase)
3. **frontend-patterns** skill validates UI aesthetics + component patterns (if frontend work)
4. **refactor-cleaner** cleans up (Refactor phase)
5. **security-reviewer** scans for vulnerabilities
6. **code-reviewer** (or language-specific reviewer) does final review
7. **e2e-runner** validates critical user journeys
8. **doc-updater** updates documentation

## Why this skill exists

The Council Protocol's Phase 0/1/2/3 templates + Research
Requirements + Post-Implementation Review are reference
material — they describe HOW to run the Council on a non-
trivial task. The Floor rule `council-default.md` keeps the
Council always-convening; the templates here lazy-load when
the work surface (plan / ADR / agent / runbook file) tells us
the templates will actually be used. For everyday coding work,
the assistant works the Council pattern from memory using the
Floor rules; the full templates load when constructing a
durable record (a plan file, an ADR, a runbook entry).

Migration provenance: lines 338-921 + lines 1416-1680 of
`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (pre-rebuild) moved into this skill +
the sister `council-rules` skill on 2026-06-02 as part of
the lazy-rules-loading plan.
