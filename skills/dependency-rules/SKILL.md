## Purpose

Five dependency-hygiene rules behind one trigger surface. When a manifest or
lockfile in any ecosystem is touched, this skill fires and routes to the one
concern the change is actually about — pinning, CVEs, overrides, licenses, or
installs.

This file is a ROUTING TABLE, not the guidance. It is `paths:`-gated, so whatever
it contains is added to the always-on Floor every time a glob above matches; the
detail therefore lives in `references/` and is read on demand. Read the row you
need in full before acting on it — the reference file is the rule, and the
one-line summary below is not a substitute for it.

## Routing

| Concern | Read this | It covers |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Pinning** — lockfile committed? caret or exact? digest on the image? SHA on the Action? | [`references/pinning.md`](references/pinning.md) | Pinning strategy per layer (application vs library), the 10 hard rules, per-ecosystem range syntax, container + CI + Renovate pinning, per-language specifics (pnpm / Go / Python / Rust / Docker), 6 anti-patterns, verification block, standards cited |
| **Vulnerability gate** — a CVE surfaced; what blocks and what ships? | [`references/vulnerability-gate.md`](references/vulnerability-gate.md) | The MODERATE+ floor and why it is non-negotiable, 11 hard rules including non-bypassable enforcement, the per-language scanner contract (pnpm / Go / Python / images), gate output shape, authoring the gate script, CI integration, Renovate security config, documented exceptions |
| **Overrides, not exceptions** — the gate failed on a transitive; now what? | [`references/overrides-not-exceptions.md`](references/overrides-not-exceptions.md) | The strict escalation order (replace → override → patch → except), 5 hard rules, the `pnpm.overrides` idiom and its npm / yarn / Go / Cargo / Maven / Gradle / pip equivalents, what to do when an override breaks the parent, the abandoned-consumer replacement table, the override-vs-exception fork worked through |
| **License allowlist** — an SPDX value is UNKNOWN or off-list | [`references/license-allowlist.md`](references/license-allowlist.md) | 7 hard rules, the default-safe SPDX allowlist and the review-required list (GPL / AGPL / SSPL / BUSL and friends), fail-closed on UNKNOWN, the Trove + GitHub License API cross-check, passing and failing gate output, authoring `verify-licenses.sh` |
| **Install allowlist** — about to install a package, extension, MCP or tap | [`references/install-allowlist.md`](references/install-allowlist.md) | 7 hard rules (no `-g` without approval, no `npx -y`, no curl-pipe-sh), the npm DO-NOT-INSTALL list, VS Code / Cursor known-bad and trusted-publisher allowlists, the MCP publisher allowlist, the Homebrew tap allowlist, what to do when the rule fires, editor settings and shell-level enforcement |

Cross-references and per-rule learning hooks live in each reference file, beside
the rule they belong to.
