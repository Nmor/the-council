## When to Activate

- Writing new Django applications
- Implementing Django REST Framework APIs
- Testing Django models, views, and serializers
- Setting up testing infrastructure for Django projects

## Purpose

Principal-level Django test methodology: pytest-django + factory_boy + freezegun + pytest-mock +
responses; transaction isolation via `pytest.mark.django_db`; reusable fixtures via session scope;
DRF APIClient patterns; coverage gates.

**Negative scope** (NOT what this skill covers):

- Django architecture under test — see `django-patterns`
- Security testing patterns — see `django-patterns`
- Deployment / coverage / build gates — see `django-testing`
- Generic Python testing — see `python-testing`
- TDD methodology (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR) — see `tdd-workflow`

Principal-level Django verification: migration safety, `manage.py check --deploy`, dependency CVE
scan, license gate, coverage thresholds, `collectstatic` validation, static analysis (ruff + mypy +
bandit), Docker image hardening, deploy gates.

**Negative scope** (NOT what this skill covers):

- Code-level patterns — see `django-patterns`
- Security config — see `django-patterns`
- Test methodology — see `django-testing`
- Generic Python verification — see `python-testing`
- Generic dependency pinning — see `dependency-pinning.md`

## When NOT to use

- Non-Django Python tests (use generic `python-testing`)
- DRF-only APIs without Django models (still mostly applies; lighter setup)
- Async-first Django ASGI tests (different fixture model — `asgi_application` fixture)

- Non-Django Python projects (use language-level verification skills)
- Native binary deploys (skip Django-specific gates)

## Anti-Patterns

| Pattern | Why bad | Correct alternative |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tests that mock the ORM | Brittle; doesn't catch query / migration regressions | Use real DB via `@pytest.mark.django_db`; transactions rolled back per test |
| Hardcoded test data inline | Duplicated across tests; brittle | factory_boy `DjangoModelFactory` with traits |
| `time.sleep(...)` in async / Celery tests | Flaky | `freezegun.freeze_time(...)` for time; `CELERY_TASK_ALWAYS_EAGER = True` for tasks |
| `self.assertEqual(..., len(qs))` after DB write | Caches query — second eval is stale | Use `assert qs.count() == N` (forces fresh query) |
| Mocking `User.objects` instead of using factory | Reimplementing the ORM | `UserFactory.create_batch(3)` |
| Tests that read `settings.DEBUG` directly | Settings frozen at import; override needs `@override_settings` | `@override_settings(DEBUG=True)` decorator |
| Skipping `pytest.mark.django_db` for "fast" tests | Database access errors at runtime | Mark explicitly; use `transaction=False` for non-mutating tests |
| Sharing factory instances between tests via module-level | Order-dependent | Per-test factories OR `@pytest.fixture` with explicit scope |

| Pattern | Why bad | Correct alternative |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `python manage.py check` without `--deploy` | Skips production-only checks (SSL redirect, HSTS, etc.) | `python manage.py check --deploy --fail-level WARNING` in CI |
| Skipping migrations validation | Migration drift between branches → merge conflicts in prod | `python manage.py makemigrations --check --dry-run` |
| `pip install -r requirements.txt` without hashes | Reproducibility theatre | `pip install --require-hashes -r requirements.txt`; pin via `pip-compile --generate-hashes` |
| `requirements.txt` only (no `requirements-dev.txt`) | Test deps in prod image | Separate files; multi-stage Docker drops dev deps in final stage |
| `collectstatic` failure ignored | Missing assets in prod 404 | Run in CI; fail build on missing static files |
| Coverage threshold 50% | No safety net | 90% touched-file / 80% project |
| Floating Docker tag `python:latest` | CVE accumulation | `FROM python:3.12.7-slim-bookworm@sha256:...` |
| Suppressing `bandit` findings without expiry | Permanent exception | `# nosec` with expiry comment OR config file with `until` date |

## Why this skill exists

Django tests can become unusable through three predictable failures: mocking the ORM (tests pass,
queries break), Thread.sleep() for async work (flaky), and fixture re-creation per test (slow
suite). pytest-django + factory_boy + freezegun + session-scoped fixtures keep the suite fast AND
faithful to production. Django's `assertRedirects`, `assertTemplateUsed`, `mail.outbox` give
expressive integration assertions for free.

Django apps regress most often at the deploy boundary: `DEBUG = True` left on, missed migrations,
missing `collectstatic`, CVE-laden transitive dependency. Each is a documented Django check or
pip-audit invocation away from being caught. The verification pipeline mechanically gates all of
them so the Django app passes both the framework's own deployment checklist AND OWASP ASVS L2.
