# GDPR / CCPA / CPRA Compliance

> **Size budget: 25 KB.** Check: wc -c. Gate: node ~/.claude/scripts/token-budget.mjs --check

The privacy regulation landscape is mechanical at the code level. This skill encodes the patterns
that move a product from "we have a privacy policy" to "we can answer a regulator's questions with
evidence."

## Purpose

GDPR (EU), UK GDPR, CCPA + CPRA (California), LGPD (Brazil), POPIA (South Africa), PIPEDA (Canada),
APPI (Japan), PDPA (Singapore) — different regulators, similar shapes. The patterns below cover the
lowest-common-denominator implementation that satisfies all named regimes.

The expensive failures: GDPR fines up to €20M / 4% global turnover; CCPA $7,500/intentional
violation; class actions in jurisdictions that allow them; loss of customer trust + brand damage.

## When to Fire

- Any field collection touching personal data (signup, profile, KYC, contact form)
- Any analytics event capturing user behaviour
- Any cookie / local storage / tracker
- Any third-party processor (Stripe, Twilio, OpenAI, etc.)
- Any data export to another region
- Any account-deletion / data-export endpoint
- Any consent banner
- Any data-retention setting

## How this skill is organised (read this first)

This skill bundles the implementation patterns plus two full migrated rules. Carrying
all of it inline made this file 49 KB — loaded in full on **every** touch of **every**
file matching the `paths:` globs above, which is most of a codebase's privacy, legal,
user and audit surface. Context is a quality resource, not just a cost one: a window
spent on the breach runbook is attention taken from the consent banner being written.

So the routing table stays here, and the detail lives in `references/`. **Read the
reference file for the concern the current change actually touches** — that is one
Read, not the whole 49 KB.
