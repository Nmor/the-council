## Purpose

Supply chain management is the discipline of orchestrating
flows across organizations that don't share a boss. The work
involves planning (what to make / buy / move when), sourcing
(who supplies what), making (production strategy), delivering
(logistics + distribution), returning (reverse logistics +
warranty), and enabling (technology + data + people +
governance) — all simultaneously, all with cost / service /
risk / sustainability trade-offs.

This skill covers the principal-level patterns: how to apply
the SCOR reference model, how to design inventory policies
that don't accumulate either stock-outs or warehouses full of
unsellable inventory, how to assess and manage supplier risk,
how to choose between push and pull replenishment, how to
think about resilience after a decade in which supply chains
have repeatedly failed publicly (COVID, Suez Canal, semiconductor
shortage, geopolitical decoupling, climate disruption).

This skill does NOT cover deep operations research (linear
programming for vehicle routing, queueing theory for warehouses)
— those are specialist domains. It frames the decisions that
specialists then optimize.

## When to Fire

This skill engages when work involves:

- Supplier selection, qualification, or risk assessment
- Inventory policy design (ROP, EOQ, safety stock, MOQ, ABC
  classification)
- Demand forecasting (statistical, judgmental, machine learning,
  collaborative)
- S&OP / IBP (Sales + Operations Planning / Integrated Business
  Planning) processes
- Push vs pull replenishment decisions
- Make-to-stock vs make-to-order vs assemble-to-order vs
  engineer-to-order strategy
- Distribution network design (number / location of warehouses,
  hub-and-spoke vs point-to-point)
- Logistics provider (3PL / 4PL) selection
- Lead-time + cycle-time analysis
- Bullwhip effect diagnosis
- Reverse logistics + returns processing
- Trade compliance (export control, customs, sanctions, tariffs,
  origin rules)
- Procurement strategy (single / dual / multi sourcing; spot vs
  contract; vertical integration vs outsourcing)
- Supply chain risk management (geopolitical, financial,
  operational, cyber, climate, reputational)
- Supply chain transparency + traceability (food, pharma,
  conflict minerals, forced labor)
- Sustainability + scope-3 emissions in the supply chain
- Last-mile delivery design
- Cold chain (temperature-controlled logistics)

It does NOT engage when the question is about software
deployment pipelines — those use the word "supply chain"
metaphorically; this skill is about physical / material supply
chains. (The sister `dependency-vulnerabilities` rule covers
software supply chain security.)

## Anti-Patterns

### Single-sourcing critical components for cost only

The Toyota brake pedal recall, the Renesas semiconductor fire,
the Suez Canal grounding — each demonstrated that single sourcing
optimized for cost creates catastrophic exposure. The fix isn't
always dual-sourcing (sometimes uneconomical); it's deliberate
risk acceptance with mitigations (safety stock, qualified
backups, scenario plans).

### Forecast as commitment

When forecasts are treated as commitments (or used to set sales
targets), forecasters game them. The supply chain runs on biased
data. Cure: separate forecast (best estimate) from plan (what
we'll do) from target (commitment); reward forecast accuracy
separately from sales performance.

### Optimizing locally, suboptimizing globally

Procurement optimizes purchase price; manufacturing optimizes
utilization; logistics optimizes truck fill — each locally
optimal, all jointly suboptimal. S&OP/IBP exists exactly to
correct this; without it, the silos win.

### "Just-in-time" without supplier capability

Pure JIT with zero inventory only works when suppliers are
short-lead-time + highly reliable. Globalized JIT in fragile
chains is "just-in-trouble." Post-COVID, many companies are
re-shoring or near-shoring + adding strategic buffer inventory.

### Ignoring tail risk

Supply chain planning often assumes Gaussian distributions for
demand + supply. Real distributions have fat tails. Once-per-
decade events happen more often than that.

### "Outsource everything except core"

A decade of aggressive outsourcing produced firms that couldn't
deliver during disruptions because they no longer owned the
capability. The pendulum swings; vertical integration of strategic
capabilities is back in some sectors (battery cells, advanced
semis).

### Procurement reports cost savings; supply chain pays the price

Claimed procurement savings often shift cost to other functions
(quality issues, expediting, customer impact). The savings are
real only when total landed cost + service impact + risk is
audited. Hence the rise of total cost of ownership (TCO) and
should-cost modelling.

### Transparency programs that gather data and do nothing

Tier-1 supplier ESG questionnaires that no one acts on are
paperwork. Real transparency programs lead to supplier development,
substitution, or de-listing.

### "Risk register" with no owners

Risks identified but not assigned to an accountable owner with
mitigation budget produce false comfort. The discipline: every
material risk has a single accountable owner, a mitigation plan,
a trigger that activates the plan, and review cadence.

### Ignoring reverse logistics

Returns, warranty, recycling, end-of-life — often handled as an
afterthought, costing 5-20% of supply chain spend. Proper design
of reverse logistics is increasingly mandatory (Extended Producer
Responsibility regulations, right-to-repair).

## Verification Checklist

For a supply chain capability or initiative:

- [ ] Product is classified (functional / innovative; commodity
      / differentiator) and supply chain is aligned to type.
- [ ] Demand forecast accuracy is measured (MAPE, bias) per item
      / customer / location.
- [ ] Inventory policy by item: service level target, ROP,
      safety stock formula, review cadence.
- [ ] S&OP / IBP runs monthly with cross-functional participation
      and outputs one shared plan.
- [ ] Suppliers segmented per Kraljic matrix; strategy per segment.
- [ ] Multi-tier supplier visibility for critical components
      (not just tier 1).
- [ ] Risk register with owners, mitigations, triggers.
- [ ] Resilience tested via scenario / war game in the last 12
      months.
- [ ] Total landed cost / TCO model used for major sourcing
      decisions, not just purchase price.
- [ ] Forecast accuracy + inventory turns + service level +
      cash-to-cash cycle time on the operations dashboard.
- [ ] Incoterms specified on every cross-border order.
- [ ] Sanctions + export-control screening at supplier onboarding
      and at order time.
- [ ] Reverse logistics process defined with metrics.
- [ ] Scope 3 emissions measured and reduction targets set.

## Why This Skill Exists

The 2020-2025 period was the largest stress test of modern
supply chains in 80 years. COVID-19, the Suez Canal blockage,
the semiconductor shortage, Russia's invasion of Ukraine,
Houthi attacks on Red Sea shipping, climate-driven port
closures — each exposed assumptions that had been quietly held
for decades:

- Just-in-time + lean inventory was always the right answer
- Globalization would continue to deepen
- Tail risks were too rare to plan for
- Single-source was acceptable if cheapest
- Tier-1 supplier visibility was sufficient
- Trade routes were free-flowing public goods

All of those assumptions are now actively in question.
Companies that had only embraced cost-efficient supply chains
saw revenue lost, customers churned, and reputations damaged.
Companies with resilience built in — through redundancy, regional
manufacturing, multi-tier visibility, buffer inventory, scenario
planning — recovered faster and emerged stronger.

The work going forward is balancing efficiency and resilience;
the right answer is not "build maximum inventory everywhere" or
"return to all-JIT." It's segmenting decisions per product
category, per geography, per risk class, and per strategic
priority — exactly the discipline this skill exists to support.

The cost of getting it wrong: stock-outs cost retail an
estimated $1.75T/year globally (IHL Group). The cost of
excess inventory: 25-35% of carrying cost per year. The cost
of major disruption: companies report 6-9 months of lost
revenue, brand damage, and customer churn. Principal-level
supply chain decisions are among the highest-stakes choices a
company makes; they deserve principal-level frameworks.

## Learning hooks

Per `~/.claude/rules/common/continuous-learning-mandate.md`:

**Signals to watch**:

- S&OP cycle not run monthly (demand-supply alignment drift)
- Demand forecast accuracy (MAPE) > 30% sustained (poor signal quality)
- Bullwhip effect observed (variance amplifying upstream) without dampening
- Single-source dependency on tier-1+ supplier (geopolitical / disaster SPOF)
- Safety stock formula not updated when lead time / variability changes
- ABC / XYZ classification stale > 12 months
- Inventory turns degrading quarter-over-quarter
- Order-promising commits without ATP / CTP check
- Supplier scorecard reviewed annually instead of quarterly
- SCOR model metrics not benchmarked against peer set
- Sustainability / scope-3 emissions not tracked in supplier evaluation (per
  `~/.claude/rules-library/common/audit-logging.md`)

**Refinement candidates**:

- New supply-chain risk row when a new disruption class emerges (e.g., cyber attack on logistics)
- New cross-reference when a sister skill (lean-manufacturing, six-sigma, esg-reviewer) adds a SC
  gate
- Tightening of the dual-source policy when SPOF incident recurs
- New S&OP template row when a new demand pattern emerges
