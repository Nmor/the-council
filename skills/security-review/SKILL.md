This skill ensures all code follows security best practices and identifies potential
vulnerabilities.

## When to Activate

- Implementing authentication or authorization
- Handling user input or file uploads
- Creating new API endpoints
- Working with secrets or credentials
- Implementing payment features (always; see § 11 Payment Security)
- Implementing escrow / trust-account / marketplace-split flows
- Implementing webhook receivers (payment / identity / messaging)
- Implementing open-banking / FAPI integrations
- Storing or transmitting sensitive data (PII, PHI, payment card,
  health, financial, biometric)
- Integrating third-party APIs

- [Web Security Academy](https://portswigger.net/web-security)

## Purpose

Principal-level security review: OWASP Top 10 (2021) coverage,
OWASP ASVS 4.0.3 mapping (L1/L2/L3), STRIDE threat modelling at
design time, secure-by-default coding patterns (parameterised
queries, output encoding, deny-by-default authz, CSP / HSTS /
SameSite cookies), secret management discipline (vault-only, never
on disk), dependency CVE gating, supply-chain integrity (SBOM,
signing, SLSA), webhook signature verification, rate limiting on
auth + sensitive endpoints, audit logging (per `audit-logging.md`),
PII redaction in logs (per `gdpr-ccpa.md`), incident response
flow (rotate FIRST, scrub LATER), and the cross-language security
checks every reviewer applies before approving a merge.

**Negative scope** (NOT what this skill covers):

- Penetration testing methodology (engage external pentesters)
- Red-team / offensive security (different discipline)
- Cryptographic protocol design (use vetted primitives; don't
  invent)
- Compliance certifications (SOC 2 / ISO 27001 audit) — separate
  workflow

## When NOT to use

- Pure-static documentation changes
- Throwaway scripts with no user input + no network exposure
- Local-only dev tooling that never reaches production

## Why this skill exists

Security defects ship to production because review is implicit:
each reviewer brings their own (incomplete) mental checklist; gaps
appear at the seams between languages, layers, and teams. Making
the review structured + OWASP-mapped + ASVS-anchored means the
review can't be skipped silently. The patterns above codify the
production-ready posture: STRIDE at design, ASVS-mapped controls
in code, vault-first secrets, CVE gate at every PR, sanitised
errors, audit log for sensitive actions, rate limit on every auth

- public endpoint. Teams that adopt these ship features without
shipping incidents; teams that don't burn engineering quarters
on incident response.

## Learning hooks

Per `~/.claude/rules/common/continuous-learning-mandate.md`:

**Signals to watch**:

- User input handler ships without input validation / sanitisation (A03 weakening)
- Authentication endpoint without rate-limit (A07 + Sonar S5876)
- Hardcoded credential reaches a commit (A02 + Sonar S2068; hook should have caught it)
- File-upload handler without size + content-type validation
- New external integration without OWASP threat-model review (Phase 0 weakening)
- IDOR pattern recurring (handler reads resource by id without ownership check) — A01
- SQL string-concat / format-string injection (A03)
- Weak crypto (MD5/SHA-1/DES) appears in code (A02 + Sonar S5547)
- Sensitive data in logs (A09; PII leaks via console.log / structured logger)
- Missing security headers (CSP / HSTS / X-Frame-Options) on new pages (A05)
- Vulnerable dep CVE reaches main (A06; dependency-vulnerabilities.md gate bypassed)
- Payment webhook handler missing signature verification (§ 11; replay-attack exposure)
- Payment webhook accepts events outside 5-min timestamp window (§ 11 replay-protection weakening)
- PAN reaches application server (§ 11 tokenization-at-edge violation; PCI scope blast)
- Card-testing velocity limit absent on checkout (§ 11; BIN-attack fraud)
- Refund pathway permits non-original-payment-method targets without explicit policy (§ 11;
  refund-laundering exposure)
- Open-banking integration ships without FAPI 2.0 conformance (§ 11; mTLS / DPoP / PAR missing)
- Idempotency-bypass detection absent on payment endpoints (§ 11; double-spend / replay exposure)
- Same-IP key-rotation anomaly unobserved on payment endpoints (card-testing fraud signal)
- Trust-account / escrow ledger NOT append-only (§ 11; audit failure + commingling risk)
- OFAC / sanctions screening missing at fund-in OR fund-out (§ 11; per-tx OFAC penalty up to $1.7M)
- Custodial escrow shipped without MTL portfolio (§ 11 + payment-processing-patterns
  Anti-pattern 10)
- 4-eyes principle absent on manual escrow release above threshold (§ 11; insider-risk exposure)
- mTLS not enforced for service-to-service inside CDE (§ 11; PCI-DSS Req 4 weakening)

**Refinement candidates**:

- New row in OWASP A01-A10 checklist when a recurring pattern surfaces in the codebase
- Threat-model template extended when a new attack class emerges (e.g., AI prompt injection,
  supply-chain typosquats)
- Cross-reference added when a sister skill (owasp-asvs, gdpr-ccpa-compliance, pci-dss-patterns,
  payment-processing-patterns, hipaa-compliance) adds a security gate
- Per-stack security checklist row when a new framework / cloud service joins the codebase
- New § 11 sub-section when a new payment-security threat class emerges (e.g., quantum-resistant
  payment crypto, post-quantum SCA, stablecoin custody attack class)
- New FAPI 2.0 conformance row when OpenID FAPI WG releases a profile update
- New OFAC / sanctions-screening vendor row when a new screening provider gains adoption (Refinitiv,
  ComplyAdvantage, Chainalysis, Sardine, Alloy)

**Remember**: Security is not optional. One vulnerability can compromise the entire platform. When
in doubt, err on the side of caution.
