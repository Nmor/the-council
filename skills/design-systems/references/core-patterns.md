## Core Patterns

### Pattern 1: Three-layer token architecture

Tokens are the source of truth. Three tiers:

```text
TIER 1: Core / primitive tokens
   --color-blue-500: #2563eb
   --space-4: 16px
   --font-size-base: 1rem

TIER 2: Semantic / alias tokens
   --color-action-primary: var(--color-blue-500)
   --color-text-emphasis: var(--color-slate-900)
   --space-form-field: var(--space-4)

TIER 3: Component tokens
   --button-primary-bg: var(--color-action-primary)
   --button-primary-text: var(--color-text-on-action)
   --button-padding-y: var(--space-form-field)
```

Why three tiers:

- **Tier 1** is the palette — refactor here changes the brand;
  don't reference Tier 1 directly in components.
- **Tier 2** is intent — "this colour means action"; rename the
  primitive without touching consumers.
- **Tier 3** is component-scoped overrides — when a button needs
  to differ from the global action colour, here is the place,
  not the component code.

Components consume Tier 3 (or Tier 2 if no override needed),
NEVER Tier 1 directly. This is the property that makes themes
swappable.

### Pattern 2: Token format that crosses platforms

Adopt the **W3C Design Tokens Community Group format**
(JSON-based). Style Dictionary transforms it into platform
artefacts:

```json
{
  "color": {
    "action": {
      "primary": {
        "$value": "{color.blue.500}",
        "$type": "color",
        "$description": "Primary action surfaces — buttons, links, focus rings."
      }
    }
  },
  "space": {
    "form": {
      "field": {
        "$value": "{space.4}",
        "$type": "dimension"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Style Dictionary builds platform outputs:

- Web: CSS custom properties, Tailwind config, SCSS variables
- iOS: Swift extensions on `UIColor` / `UIFont`
- Android: XML resource files, Compose theme
- Flutter: Dart const expressions
- React Native: JS object
- Figma: Tokens Studio JSON

One source of truth → many platform artefacts. The cost of
"another platform" drops to "add an output transform."

### Pattern 3: Component API design

A component is an API. Apply API discipline:

| Property | Rule |
| --- | --- |
| **Names** | Express role, not appearance: `Button` not `BlueButton`; `Stack` not `Flexbox`. Per `coding-style.md` naming rules. |
| **Props** | Minimal viable surface. Each prop justifies its existence: needed by ≥3 callers OR essential for a11y / variants. |
| **Defaults** | Cover the 80% case. Disabled = false, loading = false, size = "medium". |
| **Variants** | Explicit enum, not boolean explosion. `<Button variant="primary" \| "secondary" \| "ghost" \| "destructive">` beats four booleans. |
| **Composition** | Prefer composition over configuration. `<Card><Card.Header>...</Card.Header></Card>` beats `<Card title=... subtitle=...>`. |
| **Slots** | Named children for flexible content: `<Modal trigger={...} title={...}>`. |
| **Escape hatches** | `className`, `style`, `data-*` allowed; document them as escape valves, not as the primary API. |
| **Refs** | Forward refs on every interactive component for focus management. |
| **a11y** | Accessibility props (aria-label, aria-describedby) FIRST-CLASS, not optional. |

### Pattern 4: Variant + size + state matrix

Every component has implicit dimensions; surface them
explicitly:

| Dimension | Examples |
| --- | --- |
| **Variant** | primary, secondary, ghost, destructive |
| **Size** | xs, sm, md, lg, xl |
| **State** | default, hover, focus, active, disabled, loading, error |
| **Density** | comfortable, compact (for data-dense UIs) |
| **Inversion** | on-light, on-dark, on-coloured |

Each cell of the matrix needs a token resolution + a Storybook
story. Storybook + Chromatic / Percy capture every cell as a
visual regression baseline.

### Pattern 5: Accessibility built in, not bolted on

Components must be accessible by default. The contract:

- **Semantic HTML** under the hood: `<button>`, not `<div
  role="button">`
- **Focus management**: visible focus, programmatic focus on
  reveal (modal, drawer)
- **Keyboard interaction model**: matches WAI-ARIA Authoring
  Practices for the pattern (tab list, combobox, menu, etc.)
- **ARIA**: only where semantic HTML insufficient; correct roles +
  states + properties
- **Colour contrast**: ≥ 4.5:1 for text, ≥ 3:1 for non-text UI
  (WCAG 2.2 §1.4.3 + §1.4.11) — tokens already pass
- **Touch targets**: ≥ 24 × 24 (WCAG 2.2 §2.5.8), recommended
  44/48 per platform
- **Motion respects `prefers-reduced-motion`**
- **i18n**: RTL-aware (logical properties); text expansion
  tolerated

Lint rule: components without accessibility test coverage cannot
be promoted to stable.

### Pattern 6: Theming + multi-brand

A theme is a token override layered on the canonical token set.
Common needs:

- **Dark / light mode** — toggle via media query +
  user preference
- **High contrast** — for users who need ≥ 7:1 (WCAG AAA)
- **Per-brand white label** — partner / OEM theming
- **Per-tenant override** — enterprise customers brand the app
- **Density modes** — comfortable / compact

Implementation: themes are token sets; switching is a runtime
swap of the CSS custom property values, not a rebuild. Test
matrix runs across themes.

### Pattern 7: Governance + contribution model

Without governance, a design system fragments — three teams ship
three slightly different Card components and call it a day.
Governance answers:

- **Who decides what gets in?** A core team or rotating council;
  decisions logged as ADRs.
- **How do contributors propose changes?** A proposal template
  with research evidence, a11y plan, mock-up, code prototype.
- **What's the review SLA?** Stated explicitly; missing it is
  the system team's problem, not the contributor's.
- **What's the bar for promotion?** Experimental → Beta →
  Stable, with criteria for each.

Three stages of component maturity:

```text
experimental:
  - in the system; opt-in via flag
  - breaking changes allowed
  - not for production use yet

beta:
  - production-acceptable for non-critical surfaces
  - breaking changes batched, communicated
  - missing some variants OR a11y completeness

stable:
  - production-ready everywhere
  - semver discipline applies; no breaking changes without
    deprecation lifecycle per `deprecation-lifecycle.md`
  - full a11y + i18n + theming + test coverage
```

### Pattern 8: Versioning + deprecation lifecycle

Apply `semver.md` strictly. The hard part is breaking changes:

- **Patch**: bug fixes, visual tweaks within tokens, internal
  refactor
- **Minor**: new components, new props with sensible defaults,
  new tokens
- **Major**: removed components, renamed props, contract
  changes (e.g., children → slot)

Deprecation per `deprecation-lifecycle.md`:

1. **Announce** — Changelog + docs banner + migration guide
2. **Soft-deprecate** — Component still works, console warning
   on dev builds, deprecation in JSDoc
3. **Hard-deprecate** — Compile-time warning, codemod available
4. **Remove** — Next major version

Skipping stages erodes trust. Consumers will fork to escape an
unreliable upstream.

### Pattern 9: Documentation that engineers + designers

both actually use

Docs are a deliverable, not an afterthought. Apply Diátaxis:

- **Tutorial**: "Building a settings page with our system" —
  end-to-end
- **How-to**: "Theme for white label", "Make a custom Button",
  "Set up Storybook"
- **Reference**: every component, every prop, every token —
  auto-generated where possible from TypeScript / Swift / Kotlin
  sources
- **Explanation**: the philosophy, the token architecture, the
  contribution model

For every component:

- Live demo
- Props table (auto from types)
- Variant gallery
- Accessibility notes
- Do's and don'ts with screenshots
- Code examples for every supported framework
- Related components

Tools: **Storybook** (web), **Compose Preview** (Android),
**SwiftUI Preview** (iOS), **zeroheight** / **Supernova** for
cross-discipline browsing.

### Pattern 10: Testing — visual + interaction + a11y + token

contract

Components ship with four classes of test:

- **Visual regression** (Chromatic / Percy / Reg-CLI): every
  variant × state × theme; PRs gate on diff approval
- **Interaction** (Playwright Component Testing / Storybook
  Interactions / @testing-library): click, type, keyboard
  navigation, expected DOM state
- **Accessibility** (axe-core / Playwright a11y / IBM Equal
  Access): zero serious violations in any story
- **Token contract**: tokens referenced in components must exist
  in the token set; CI fails when components reference removed
  tokens

### Pattern 11: Adoption telemetry — make the invisible visible

"Are people using the system?" should not be a guess. Build
adoption telemetry:

- **Static analysis**: ESLint / SwiftLint / detekt rule
  detecting import of design-system components; count usages per
  repo, per route, per team
- **Runtime telemetry** (optional, privacy-respecting): emit a
  beacon when a stable component renders; aggregate
- **Visual diff**: snapshot a competitor surface vs the
  system-built surface; drift = adoption gap
- **Issue volume**: support volume for "I built a custom X
  because the system one didn't fit" reveals API gaps

Report adoption per surface, per team, per quarter to leadership.
Without this, the design system team is invisible until budget
cuts.

### Pattern 12: Cross-platform parity — accept platform

conventions

A common failure: forcing one platform's idioms onto another. A
Material-style FAB on iOS feels wrong; a UIKit-style segmented
control on Android feels wrong. Strategies:

- **Same TOKENS, platform-native COMPONENTS**: shared brand
  expression, platform-idiomatic interaction
- **Cross-platform layout primitives** (Stack, Grid) align;
  controls (segmented control, picker) diverge
- **Web is its own platform**: don't force a mobile component
  onto desktop or vice versa
- **Accept that motion + haptics + density** vary by platform

The goal is consistent BRAND, not identical PIXELS. Document the
trade-off.

### Pattern 13: Open-source-aware reuse

Per `reuse-first.md`. The system team's job is NOT to reimplement
every primitive:

- Focus + scroll lock on modals → use `radix-ui` /
  `react-aria` / `@headlessui` / `Ariakit` instead of hand-rolling
- Date pickers → curated wrapping of `react-day-picker` or
  similar
- Charts → wrap `Recharts` / `visx` / `Apache ECharts`, don't
  ship a charting framework
- Markdown → `markdown-it` + sanitiser
- Drag and drop → `dnd-kit` (web), `react-native-reanimated`
  (RN)

Wrap, theme, and document — don't re-create. Save your effort
for the parts that ARE differentiated.

### Pattern 14: Living style guide — not a frozen spec

A static style guide rots. A LIVING system updates itself when
the code or tokens change:

- Tokens defined in code; docs render the values at build
- Components rendered in docs from the same source the product
  uses
- Auto-generated prop tables
- Auto-deployed previews per PR
- Changelog generated from conventional commits

Manual maintenance of docs is the road to drift.

### Pattern 15: Migration tooling for breaking changes

Major version bumps without codemods strand consumers. Provide:

- **JS/TS**: `jscodeshift` codemods per breaking change
- **Swift**: structured patch instructions; `swift-syntax`
  refactors where feasible
- **CSS**: regex-replacement scripts where deterministic
- **Markdown migration guide** with before/after for every
  breaking change

A codemod that handles 90% of cases earns goodwill the next
breaking change will cash in.

### Pattern 16: Visual quality grounded in the product

Start from the audience, task and existing identity. Search for suitable components
and tokens in the project before adding another system. Reuse what fits; create missing
components deliberately with the same accessibility and API conventions. A hand-built
component is not automatically a quality failure, and a library is not automatically a fit.

Use licensed references or a provided design to understand hierarchy, spacing and
interaction. Optional component registries and design tools can help when available,
compatible and authorized. Check their licenses, dependency cost and actual output.
Do not mandate paid tools, install integrations by default or copy a competitor's identity.
For wider art direction use [brand creative direction](../../brand-creative-direction/SKILL.md).

Define consistent type, spacing, semantic color, radius and motion scales where relevant.
Support the themes and media the brief requires. Familiar fonts and standard layouts
are valid choices when they support the task. Test responsive behavior, accessibility
and representative content. Inspect the rendered result and iterate against the brief;
state what was verified. Use real claims and trust signals or clearly labeled placeholders.
