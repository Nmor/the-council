## Purpose

MEP coordination is the discipline that turns parallel design
disciplines into a single buildable + operable building. Each
discipline (mechanical / electrical / plumbing / fire protection /
telecom / AV / security / building management systems) generates
its own routes, equipment, ceiling-zone demands, vibration +
acoustic isolation requirements, access + maintenance needs, and
power + heat loads. When their work is reconciled only on the
construction site, the result is rework, schedule slippage, hard
hat clashes, and an operable building that still doesn't perform.

This skill provides principal-level literacy in MEP coordination
for decision-makers: project managers, architects, structural
engineers, design technology leads, BIM managers, owner's reps,
and software engineers building or integrating BIM / clash
detection / IoT / building-performance tooling.

This skill does NOT cover deep MEP engineering design — those
are licensed disciplines (PE, CEng, or equivalent). It frames
the cross-discipline orchestration problem.

## When to Fire

This skill engages when work involves:

- BIM coordination workflow + tooling (Revit, Navisworks,
  Solibri, Tekla BIMsight, BIM 360 Coordinate, Trimble Connect)
- LOD specifications + BIM execution plan (BEP) per ISO 19650
- Clash detection — hard, soft, workflow clashes
- Discipline-to-discipline coordination (M+E+P+FP+ST+AR)
- Plenum / ceiling zone allocation (ductwork vs piping vs
  conduit vs structure depth vs lighting)
- MEP penetrations through structure
- Equipment lay-down + maintenance access
- Vibration + acoustic isolation
- Electrical load calculations + panel scheduling
- Mechanical load (heating + cooling + ventilation) calculations
- Plumbing fixture counts + DFU/WSFU calculations
- Fire-protection design (sprinklers, alarms, suppression)
- Datacenter MEP — power + cooling + redundancy + monitoring
- Healthcare MEP — pressure regimes, isolation rooms, medical
  gases, redundancy
- Lab MEP — fume hoods, exhaust make-up air, special hazards
- High-rise MEP — pumping schemes, smoke control, riser
  shafts
- Commissioning + retro-commissioning programs
- Owner's project requirements (OPR) + basis of design (BOD)
- Construction sequencing + trade hand-offs
- O&M handover (record drawings, asset registers, BMS
  configuration)
- Performance issues post-occupancy (the "soft commissioning"
  loop)

It does NOT engage for actual licensed MEP engineering design
— those calculations and stamped drawings require licensed
practitioners.

## Anti-Patterns

### Coordination begins in the field

Coordination meetings start during construction; the design
team never resolved discipline conflicts. The result: GC
rework, schedule delay, RFI flood, claims. Cost ratio
documented at 5-30× the cost of resolving in design (depending
on stage of catch).

### "Cartoon" BIM — looks like a model, isn't coordinated

Architectural + structural + MEP each have their own Revit
file. They never federate or clash-detect. The model misleads
everyone into thinking coordination has happened.

### Ignoring access for maintenance

The design satisfies "fits in the space" but doesn't satisfy
"can be serviced." 2-3 years post-occupancy, FM teams discover
they can't access valves, replace filters, or pull tubes.
Retrofitting access is expensive + disruptive.

### Single-firm "design-build" without discipline expertise

Design-build can compress coordination if disciplines are
under one roof. Or it can hide coordination gaps under
contractual unity — until field installation reveals them.
Discipline expertise + coordination discipline both required.

### Owner's Project Requirements never written or updated

Without an OPR, every design decision is by default. Without
maintenance, the OPR is a relic of conceptual design that
doesn't reflect Owner's actual expectations. Mature programs
update OPR through design + post-occupancy.

### Commissioning compressed into the last week

"Just go through the checklist, GC needs to close out by
Friday." Real commissioning verifies sequences of operation
against design intent — takes weeks at minimum, runs across
seasons for HVAC. Compressed Cx becomes a paper exercise.

### Late-stage MEP scope additions

Owner adds requirements during CDs ("we need 100 more
workstations") that cascade: more power, more cooling, more
ventilation, more plumbing, more fire-alarm devices.
Coordination unravels. Either accept the delay/cost or
defer the addition.

### "Generic equipment" placeholders never updated

Schematic design uses generic equipment. CD design
substitutes specific equipment. Specific equipment has
different dimensions, weights, connections, clearances than
generic. Updates not propagated through coordination =
clashes at install.

### Vibration / acoustic isolation as afterthought

Equipment chosen for cost / efficiency without vibration +
acoustic specs. Residents over mechanical complain. Studios
adjacent to AHUs are unusable. Retrofit isolation is rarely
feasible.

### "Coordination is the contractor's problem"

If the design team ships uncoordinated drawings, the GC's
job becomes coordination — they aren't designers. RFIs,
schedule impact, change orders, sometimes design liability.
Get the design team to coordinate during design.

## Verification Checklist

For a project involving MEP coordination:

- [ ] BIM Execution Plan (BEP) per ISO 19650 in place naming
      LOD per discipline per milestone.
- [ ] All MEP disciplines + structure + architecture in
      federated model.
- [ ] Clash detection running weekly or biweekly through DD +
      CD.
- [ ] Clash log with owner + resolution + due date.
- [ ] Ceiling zone allocation documented for representative
      zones.
- [ ] Equipment access + maintenance clearances verified.
- [ ] Vibration + acoustic isolation specified per use case.
- [ ] OPR + BOD written + updated.
- [ ] Commissioning Agent engaged early, OPR-reviewed.
- [ ] All penetrations through structure on coordinated SEOR-
      reviewed drawings.
- [ ] Power calculations + panel schedules consistent across
      discipline-of-record + IT + AV + security + signage
      loads.
- [ ] Mechanical loads match architectural envelope + glazing
      + internal load assumptions.
- [ ] Plumbing fixture count satisfies occupancy + code.
- [ ] Fire protection sprinkler coverage + alarm device
      coverage modelled + verified.
- [ ] Trade fabrication LODs agreed if shop drawings are model-
      based.

## Why This Skill Exists

MEP rework is consistently cited as among the top three
construction cost overrun drivers. Studies (NIST GCR 04-867,
2004) estimate the cost of inadequate interoperability across
the US construction industry at $15.8B annually — the bulk
of which is MEP coordination loss. Modern BIM workflows have
reduced this dramatically when they're actually used; they're
not always actually used.

Beyond cost: uncoordinated MEP produces buildings that don't
perform as designed. The performance gap (designed-vs-actual
energy use) on US commercial buildings is documented at
25-100% (NBI / DOE studies). Most of that gap is operational +
controls + behaviour, but a significant share is
uncoordinated installation: airflow that can't reach designed
zones, control sequences that don't match installed dampers,
return paths that aren't sealed.

For the engineering / software stakeholder, MEP coordination
matters because:

- BIM tooling (Revit, Navisworks, Solibri, IFC, BCF) is the
  foundation
- Sensor + IoT + BMS data depends on as-built fidelity
- Energy + sustainability targets depend on system performance
- Datacenter + healthcare + lab + high-performance buildings
  all live or die on MEP

This skill exists to ensure that the cross-discipline
coordination conversation is informed at the principal level
— so the right tools are funded, the right meetings happen,
the right LODs are required, and the right commissioning
discipline is enforced.

The cost of getting it right at design time is a fraction of
the cost of catching it in the field — and a tiny fraction of
the cost of carrying it through 30-50 years of building
operation.

## Learning hooks

Per `~/.claude/rules/common/continuous-learning-mandate.md`:

**Signals to watch**:

- Trade-by-trade design without coordination (clash discovered at install)
- BIM model LOD set too low for trade hand-off (LOD-300 used where LOD-400 needed)
- Maintenance access not designed (filter / valve / coil unreachable)
- Commissioning plan absent — system handed over without verification
- Energy model run only at design completion (vs iterative through schematic)
- ASHRAE 90.1 / Title 24 / Part L compliance verified at submission only (not by-design)
- Acoustic / IAQ requirements deferred (added cost on retrofit)
- Coordination drawings shipped without trade sign-off
- Spec / drawings conflict unresolved on bid documents
- O&M deliverables (manuals, AS-builts, training) skipped

**Refinement candidates**:

- New BIM/LOD row when ISO 19650 ships major update
- New cross-reference when a sister skill (structural-basics, datacenter-ops) adds an MEP gate
- New commissioning template when a recurring failure class emerges
- Tightening of the clash-detection rule when field rework recurs
