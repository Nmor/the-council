## Purpose

Lean Startup is a methodology for building businesses + products
under conditions of **extreme uncertainty** — when you don't yet
know who the customer is, what they want, or whether they will
pay. It replaces the traditional "write a business plan, raise
money, build the thing, launch big" model with a disciplined
loop: form hypotheses, build the smallest possible test, measure
real customer behaviour, learn what's true, decide to **pivot**
or **persevere**, and repeat.

Lean Startup answers a specific class of question: "Should this
thing exist at all? Will anyone pay? Which version of it?" It
does **not** answer "How do we execute a known plan efficiently?"
— that's a Lean Manufacturing question. Confusing the two is the
single most common misapplication.

This skill provides:

1. The build–measure–learn loop and its inversion (think-do-check)
2. MVP taxonomy and the discipline of "minimum AND viable"
3. Innovation accounting (actionable vs vanity metrics)
4. Pivot/persevere decision frameworks (10 pivot types)
5. Steve Blank's Customer Development integration
6. Business Model Canvas + Value Proposition Canvas
7. Three engines of growth (sticky, viral, paid)
8. Problem-solution fit → product-market fit → scale stages
9. Continuous deployment as a lean enabler
10. When NOT to use Lean Startup (and what to use instead)

It does NOT substitute for execution craft once product-market
fit is reached — Lean is for the *search* phase; scaling is a
different discipline.

## When to Fire

This skill activates on file patterns + keywords + scope signals.

**File patterns**:

- `**/lean-canvas*`, `**/business-model*`, `**/value-proposition*`
- `**/discovery-notes*`, `**/customer-interviews/**`,
  `**/user-research/**`
- `**/mvp-plan*`, `**/experiment-design*`, `**/hypothesis*`
- `**/north-star*`, `**/okrs/*`, `**/growth-strategy*`
- `**/pivot-analysis*`, `**/persevere*`, `**/innovation-accounting*`
- `**/cohort-analysis*`, `**/retention-report*`
- Strategy + product-management dirs (`product/`, `strategy/`,
  `discovery/`)

**Keyword triggers** (in prompts, plans, tickets):

- "MVP", "minimum viable product", "validated learning"
- "pivot", "persevere", "pivot-or-persevere"
- "build-measure-learn", "BML loop"
- "customer development", "get out of the building",
  "customer interviews"
- "problem–solution fit", "product–market fit", "PMF"
- "lean canvas", "business model canvas", "value proposition
  canvas"
- "innovation accounting", "actionable metrics", "vanity metrics"
- "cohort analysis", "split test", "A/B test", "concierge MVP",
  "Wizard of Oz", "smoke test"
- "engine of growth", "sticky/viral/paid"
- "JTBD", "jobs to be done"
- "north star metric", "OEC"
- "growth team", "growth hacking", "AARRR"

**Scope signals**:

- New venture / new product line / new market segment
- Existing product seeing unexplained churn or stagnant growth
- Roadmap planning where feature priorities have low confidence
- Investment / funding decisions requiring evidence of traction
- "We don't know if anyone wants this" conversations
- M&A integration where the acquired team's product-strategy is
  unclear
- Internal incubation / corporate venture / spin-out

If the work is **execution against a validated plan** (the
customer is known, the willingness-to-pay is known, the build is
the constraint), Lean Startup is NOT the right lens — use Agile
delivery + Lean Manufacturing discipline instead.

## Cross-References

- **`design-thinking`** — generates the problem framing + initial
  hypotheses that Lean Startup then tests at scale. The "Define"
  POV statement maps to Lean Startup's hypothesis.
- **`triz-patterns`** — when Lean Startup uncovers a hard
  technical contradiction at the heart of the solution, TRIZ
  resolves it.
- **`ux-research`** — qualitative customer discovery methods
  (interviews, ethnographies) used inside Customer Development
  and Continuous Discovery.
- **`okr-framework`** — outcome metrics that go in the Objectives;
  Lean Startup's actionable metrics make natural Key Results.
- **`business-model-canvas`** — strategic frame within which
  hypotheses are organised.
- **`product-discovery`** — Cagan + Torres delivery integration;
  dual-track agile execution detail.
- **`ab-testing`** — the experimentation discipline used inside
  the BML loop once the product has live traffic.
- **`cohort-analysis`** — innovation accounting requires cohort
  tables; this skill covers the analytic patterns.
- **`growth-engineering`** — once PMF is reached, growth team
  patterns (AARRR funnel, high-tempo testing).
- **`continuous-deployment`** — small batches lean enabler.

## Learning hooks

Per `~/.claude/rules/common/continuous-learning-mandate.md`:

**Signals to watch**:

- MVP scope inflated to "minimum lovable product" (BMVP — Big Minimum Viable Product)
- Build-measure-learn loop > 4 weeks (cycle-time weakening)
- Validated learning conflated with feature usage (correlation ≠ causation)
- Pivot deferred past 3 failed cycles (sunk-cost weakening)
- Engine-of-growth (sticky / viral / paid) not declared and measured
- Vanity metrics (registrations, page views) used instead of actionable cohort metrics
- Customer development interviews replaced by surveys (interview discipline weakening)
- Innovation accounting metrics not tracked across pivots
- Pre-launch "perfectionism" delays release indefinitely
- Founder-led customer discovery delegated too early

**Refinement candidates**:

- New MVP-pattern row when a new prototyping technique becomes broadly applicable
- New cross-reference when a sister skill (design-thinking, ux-research, strategy-reviewer) adds a
  startup gate
- Tightening of the pivot-trigger discipline when sunk-cost incidents recur
- New cohort-metric template when a new engine-of-growth class emerges
