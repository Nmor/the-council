description: Full Council Structure — Core Five Divisions (Architecture/Implementation/Quality/Security/Testing) + Extended Eleven Divisions (Compliance/UX/Ops/Data/Finance/Risk/Strategy/People/ESG/AI-Ethics/Comms) with veto authority + agent rosters + per-division personas (collective experience, core principles, key deliverables, checklists, red flags) + Conversation Rules (order of speaking, research depth, disagreement protocol, escalation to user). Use when authoring/editing agent files, running Council debates, resolving division tiebreakers, or training new contributors on Council conventions.

## When to activate

This skill fires when:

- Any agent file under `~/.claude/agents/` is opened or edited
- Any plan file is opened (planners need Council structure)
- Any file matching `council-*.md` under `rules/common/` is touched
- Workspace `COUNCIL.md` files are opened

The Floor rules `council-default.md` + `council-triggers.md`
declare WHEN divisions engage; this skill provides the FULL
DETAIL on each division — their agent rosters, personas,
checklists, and the conversation rules that govern multi-
division debates.

## Standards Cited

The frameworks the division catalogue triggers on and reviews against; the triggers and
vetoes that apply them live in the references.

- **OWASP Top 10**: Division 4's baseline review checklist
- **GDPR** (incl. Article 22 automated decisions, Article 8 children), **CCPA / CPRA**
- **HIPAA / HITECH** and **42 CFR Part 2**: the health sub-cluster
- **PCI-DSS**: the payments sub-cluster
- **FERPA / COPPA**: the education sub-cluster
- **ISO/IEC 27001**, **ISO 9001:2026**, **ISO 14001**, **ITIL 4**: the frameworks the
  division structure was researched against (`references/trigger-catalog.md`)
- **WCAG 2.2 AA**: accessibility on user-facing and assessment paths

## Routing table

This skill is `paths:`-gated, so whatever it holds is added to the always-on
Floor IN FULL whenever a glob matches. The detail therefore lives in
`references/`; this page routes to it. Read only the row(s) the task needs.

## Why this skill exists

The Council Structure detail, Extended Eleven specifics,
per-division personas, conversation rules, and disagreement
protocols are REFERENCE material the assistant consults when:

- Authoring or editing an agent file (the agent IS one of these
  division roles; the skill clarifies the role's scope)
- Running a Council debate that needs the full per-division
  checklist (most everyday tasks invoke divisions from memory
  via Floor's `council-default.md`)
- Resolving a tiebreaker the Floor rules can't (Floor names the
  veto matrix; this skill names the divisions' personas in
  enough detail to inform the casting vote)

Everyday code work doesn't need this level of detail loaded;
the Council Phase 1 happens from memory + Floor knowledge.
This skill exists to provide the durable record when the
assistant authors something Council-shaped (an agent file, a
plan, a runbook, an ADR).
