description: Principal-level patterns for accepting card / bank / wallet / instant-rail payments — idempotency, 3DS2 + SCA, network tokenization, subscriptions, dunning, refunds + chargebacks, payouts, ledger reconciliation. Sister to pci-dss-patterns (compliance) and bookkeeping-patterns (double-entry).

## Purpose

Principal-level guidance for building systems that accept payment
across cards (Visa / Mastercard / Amex / Discover / JCB / UPI /
Diners), bank rails (ACH NACHA, SEPA, FedNow / RTP, Faster
Payments, PIX, UPI), wallets (Apple Pay / Google Pay / PayPal /
Cash App / Venmo / Alipay / WeChat Pay), and instant transfer
networks. Covers checkout, recurring subscriptions, marketplace
split payments, payouts to merchants / sellers / 1099 contractors,
refunds, partial captures, dispute / chargeback lifecycle,
reconciliation against processor settlement files, and ledger
double-entry per `bookkeeping-patterns`.

**Out of scope (deliberate)**:

- PCI-DSS compliance mechanics — covered by `pci-dss-patterns`
- Double-entry bookkeeping mechanics — covered by `bookkeeping-patterns`
- Revenue recognition under IFRS 15 / ASC 606 — covered by `ifrs-gaap-reporting`
- Tax calculation (sales tax, VAT, GST) — separate vendor concern
- FX hedging / treasury — separate `fp-and-a` skill
- Crypto rails — separate concern (consult on-chain payment skill when added)

## How this skill is organised (read this first)

This skill is `paths:`-gated, so when a glob above matches, whatever is in this file is
added to the always-on context Floor IN FULL. Carrying every pattern inline made it
43 KB — paid before a single line of the actual change is written. Context is a quality
resource, not only a cost one: a window spent on escrow licensing is attention taken
from the idempotency key being written three files away.

So the routing table stays here and the detail lives in `references/`. **Read the
reference file for the concern the current change actually touches** — that is one
Read, not the whole 43 KB. Nothing was dropped in the split; every pattern, code
example, table, standard and anti-pattern below has a row.

| Reference | Topic | What it holds |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`idempotency.md`](references/idempotency.md) | Idempotency | Pattern 1 (1a-1h): cache-key composition (`tenant + endpoint + api_version + key`), in-progress collision (HTTP 409), payload-hash binding (HTTP 422), TTL per operation class, multi-region key-store consistency, client-side key generation, webhook event-id dedupe, idempotency observability metrics |
| [`authorization-and-sca.md`](references/authorization-and-sca.md) | Authorization + SCA | Patterns 2-3: the PaymentIntent state machine (never infer success from HTTP 200), 3DS2 + PSD2 SCA frictionless-first, exemptions (TRA, low-value, MIT, corporate), rich-data fields, per-BIN fail-rate tracking |
| [`tokenization-and-subscriptions.md`](references/tokenization-and-subscriptions.md) | Tokenization + subscriptions | Patterns 4-5: network tokens (VTS / MDES / AETS) over PAN, device vs cloud tokens, subscription + dunning state machine, retry cadence, Account Updater (Visa AU / Mastercard ABU / Amex Cardrefresher), failed-payment recovery copy |
| [`refunds-and-disputes.md`](references/refunds-and-disputes.md) | Refunds + disputes | Patterns 6-7: auth-hold / capture-on-ship, partial captures, refund state decoupled from order state, scheme refund reason codes, chargeback lifecycle (inquiry → representment → pre-arbitration → arbitration), VCR / MDR / Amex taxonomies and SLAs |
| [`payouts-and-reconciliation.md`](references/payouts-and-reconciliation.md) | Payouts, reconciliation + currency | Patterns 8-10: marketplace splits (Stripe Connect / Adyen for Platforms / Square Multiparty), payout rails and SLAs, KYC/KYB gating, daily settlement-file reconciliation with double-entry journals, presentment vs settlement currency, DCC disclosure rules |
| [`escrow.md`](references/escrow.md) | Escrow + trust accounts | Pattern 11 (11a-11j): the four escrow shapes and their licensing, Stripe Connect delayed-transfer code, escrow state machine, trust-account segregation (FBO, no commingling, three-way reconciliation, MTL / FinCEN / 1099-K / OFAC), real-estate + M&A + 1031-QI specifics, simple-hold pattern, reserves, cross-border FX, AML / KYC / KYB, dispute + reversal workflow |
| [`anti-patterns.md`](references/anti-patterns.md) | Anti-patterns | The 13 anti-patterns to reject, each with its named alternative — PAN storage, keyless retries, processor-200-as-settled, unverified webhooks, silent auto-renew, hard-deleted history, hard-coded currency precision, leaked processor errors, commingled escrow, unlicensed custody, unbound idempotency keys, in-memory idempotency caches, dispute-window-free escrow release |

## Anti-Patterns

The thirteen anti-patterns this skill rejects — and the named alternative for each —
live in [`references/anti-patterns.md`](references/anti-patterns.md). Read it before
writing the code, not during review: every one of them ships green.
