## Purpose

Ruby 3.3+ / Rails 7-8 discipline for production code: small classes and methods per Sandi
Metz, frozen string literals, RuboCop at a strict baseline, the four Rails object patterns
(service / form / query / value), OWASP-mapped Rails security, and RSpec at strict. The
bodies below were migrated from `~/.claude/rules-library/ruby/`.

## Routing table

This skill uses progressive disclosure: the detail lives in `references/`, one concern per
file. Read the row you need — not the whole set.

| Topic | Read |
| --- | --- |
| Coding style — naming, Sandi Metz rules, frozen string literals, modern Ruby idioms (endless methods, pattern matching, hash shorthand, numbered block params), class structure, modules + mixins, Rails-specific style, strict `.rubocop.yml` | [`references/coding-style.md`](references/coding-style.md) |
| Hooks + CI — pre-commit gates on staged Ruby files, Rails initializer hooks (security headers, parameter filtering), the CI workflow | [`references/hooks.md`](references/hooks.md) |
| No-discards (Ruby) — the fifteen banned patterns (bare `rescue`, `rescue nil`, `send` with user input, `eval`, suppressions, unsynchronised `Hash#[]=`, `puts`, `Time.now`, deep `ENV`, monkey-patching, unordered `find_each`, `update_columns`, `for ... in`, discarded multiple assignment), required tooling, verification block | [`references/no-discards.md`](references/no-discards.md) |
| Rails object patterns — service objects, form objects, query objects, value objects, concerns vs inheritance, ActiveRecord pitfalls, reuse-first | [`references/patterns.md`](references/patterns.md) |
| Security — OWASP Top 10 mapped to Rails (A01-A10), CSRF + strong parameters, secrets, required security tooling | [`references/security.md`](references/security.md) |
| Testing — Rails test pyramid, RSpec idioms, FactoryBot, WebMock + VCR, Capybara + Cuprite system tests, the ten hard rules | [`references/testing.md`](references/testing.md) |
