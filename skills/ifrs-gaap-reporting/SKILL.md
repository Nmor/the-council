## Purpose

Financial statements are the universal language of business — how the company reports its position
(balance sheet) and performance (income statement, cash flow, equity changes) to investors, lenders,
tax authorities, regulators, customers, and partners. IFRS (used by 140+ countries) and US GAAP
(used by the United States, Japan partially) are the two dominant frameworks; both converged
significantly through the 2007-2018 joint projects but remain distinct on important topics.

This skill teaches the engineering-side patterns for producing IFRS/GAAP-compliant financial
statements from the general ledger: the chart-of-accounts mapping to statement lines, the revenue
recognition logic (IFRS 15 / ASC 606), the lease accounting transformation (IFRS 16 / ASC 842),
period-close mechanics, consolidation patterns, and the IFRS↔GAAP differences that matter for
cross-border systems. The skill builds on `bookkeeping-patterns` — that one defines the ledger; this
one renders it into statements.

The reporting layer is where finance, accounting, audit, and engineering meet. Engineering owns the
systems that produce the data; finance owns the interpretation and the policy choices; auditors
verify the outcome; regulators (SEC, IFRS-IOSCO, ESMA, tax authorities) enforce it. Getting the
engineering right means finance closes faster, auditors find less, and the company can move with
confidence.

## When to Fire

- Building the period-end financial statement generation pipeline (BS, IS, CF, equity)
- Implementing revenue recognition logic (subscription, multi-element contracts, milestones)
- Setting up the lease accounting (right-of-use asset, lease liability)
- Cross-border systems where US GAAP and IFRS both apply
- Mapping ledger accounts to financial statement line items (account mapping)
- Implementing inventory valuation (FIFO / weighted average / LIFO — LIFO permitted under US GAAP
  only)
- Computing depreciation / amortization across the asset register
- Goodwill / intangible asset impairment testing
- Provision calculations (warranties, returns, deferred tax)
- Group reporting / consolidation (intercompany eliminations)
- Restating prior-period figures after error discovery (IAS 8 / ASC 250)
- First-time IFRS adoption (IFRS 1) or IFRS-to-GAAP / GAAP-to-IFRS conversion
- IPO readiness (S-1 / F-1 filings)
- Internal management reporting vs external statutory reporting differences
- Tax provision (deferred tax, current tax, ETR computation)

## Core Patterns

Seven patterns, each held in full in its own reference file. Read the one the task reaches.

| Pattern | Holds | Reference file |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Pattern 1: Account-to-statement-line mapping | `statement_line_mappings` schema; IFRS balance sheet (IAS 1 §54) and income statement (IAS 1 §82) roll-ups; effective-dated mapping versions | `references/statement-mapping.md` |
| Pattern 2: Revenue recognition (IFRS 15 / ASC 606 — the 5-step model) | The 5 steps; `Contract` + `PerformanceObligation` shapes; the monthly recognition job and `computeRecognition`; variable consideration | `references/revenue-recognition.md` |
| Pattern 3: Lease accounting (IFRS 16 / ASC 842) | Right-of-use asset + lease liability; initial measurement; monthly depreciation, interest and payment journals | `references/lease-accounting.md` |
| Pattern 4: Statement of Cash Flows (IAS 7 / ASC 230) | Operating / investing / financing; the indirect-method generator; the opening + net change = closing validation | `references/cash-flow-statement.md` |
| Pattern 5: IFRS ↔ GAAP differences that matter | The topic-by-topic difference table; what dual-reporting entities need | `references/ifrs-gaap-differences.md` |
| Pattern 6: Consolidation + intercompany eliminations | `consolidated_entities` + `intercompany_balances` schemas; the elimination step | `references/consolidation-and-restatement.md` |
| Pattern 7: Restating prior periods (IAS 8 / ASC 250) | Retrospective restatement; audit trail; voluntary policy changes | `references/consolidation-and-restatement.md` |

## Anti-Patterns

All seven are held in full in `references/anti-patterns.md`, with the reasoning and the named
alternative for each.

| Anti-pattern | Rejected because |
| --- | --- |
| 1. Statement generation as a one-off SQL query | Breaks on every chart-of-accounts change; use the mapping table |
| 2. Revenue = cash received | Violates the 5-step model; upfront subscriptions are a contract liability |
| 3. Lease accounting in Excel | Modifications and re-measurement fail the second audit cycle |
| 4. Cash flow as a manual reconciliation | Fragile and slow; generate from the ledger and validate |
| 5. Maintaining two separate ledgers for IFRS + GAAP | Diverges over time; use adjustment journals + parallel views |
| 6. Ignoring expected credit losses (IFRS 9 / ASC 326) | Receivables without an ECL / CECL allowance understate loss exposure |
| 7. Reporting prematurely | A fast close that skips reconciliations produces restatements |
