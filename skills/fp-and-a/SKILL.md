## Purpose

Financial Planning & Analysis (FP&A) turns the static historical accounting record into
forward-looking business intelligence: budgets, forecasts, variance analysis, scenarios, what-if
modelling, and the SaaS / commerce / fintech metrics boards and investors actually care about.
Finance owns the analysis; engineering owns the pipelines, the data models, and the self-serve
tooling that lets the FP&A team work at speed.

This skill teaches the engineering patterns for FP&A: budget vs actuals tables, rolling 13-week cash
forecasts, driver-based models (revenue × take rate, headcount × loaded cost), scenario branches,
the canonical SaaS metric definitions (ARR / MRR with all the edge cases — upgrades, downgrades,
churn, contraction, expansion), cohort retention curves, CAC / payback / LTV, and the warehouse + BI
patterns that turn the general ledger plus operational data into Tableau / Looker / Hex / Sigma
dashboards finance can actually use.

Without good FP&A engineering, finance spends 80% of its time wrangling spreadsheets and 20% on
analysis. With good FP&A engineering, finance spends 80% on analysis and 20% on edge cases — and the
board sees decisions made on data that updates daily, not quarterly.

## When to Fire

- Setting up budget vs actual reporting
- Building a rolling forecast pipeline (typically 12-24 months, refreshed monthly)
- Implementing a driver-based model
- Reporting SaaS metrics (ARR, MRR, NRR, GRR, CAC, LTV, payback, magic number)
- Cohort analysis (retention, expansion, LTV by cohort)
- Building a 13-week cash forecast for treasury
- Scenario planning (base / upside / downside; what-if questions from board / investors)
- Department-level expense tracking and variance
- Headcount planning + loaded cost modelling
- Sales pipeline-to-revenue conversion modelling
- ARR roll-forward (new + expansion - churn - contraction)
- KPI dashboard for executive team or board
- Investor / lender / acquirer due diligence data room preparation
- Capital allocation decisions (R&D vs S&M vs G&A trade-offs)
- Long-range plan (3-5 year) for strategic planning
- Cross-functional cost allocation (cloud cost to product line)
- Treasury management and working capital optimisation
