description: SonarLint / SonarQube / SonarJS rule catalogue (full 269-rule reference) plus per-language equivalents (golangci-lint, ruff, rubocop, errorlint, NullAway, clippy). Use when touching any code file to sweep against the highest-signal Sonar rules (S100, S107, S125, S138, S1192, S1481, S1854, S2068, S3358, S3776, S5547, S6571, S6606, S6594, S6644, S6759, S7755, S7773, S7780, S7781), apply per-file overrides for legitimate exceptions (test files, SSRF validators, domain nouns), and configure eslint-plugin-sonarjs at sonarjs/recommended.

> This rule fires on every file. Whenever Claude touches code in any project — new or legacy, with

> **Threshold-tightening note**: `extreme-lint-policy.md` overrides the Sonar default thresholds
> globally. Specifically: cognitive complexity (S3776) cap is **10** (not 15), function lines (S138)
> cap is **80** (not 200), function parameters (S107) cap is **5** (not 7), file lines (S104) cap is
> **500** (not 1000), nested control-flow depth (S134) cap is **3** (not 4), boolean expression
> operators (S1067) cap is **2** (not 3), magic-number tolerance (S109) allows only `0, 1, -1, 2`.
> This file lists the Sonar rule IDs + canonical defaults; the strict overrides in
> `extreme-lint-policy.md` are what the project enforces.

## Why this is global

SonarLint is a quality safety net that catches the same bugs across every language. Running it as a
global default means:

- Every project benefits, even ones that don't have SonarLint installed locally.
- Claude doesn't wait to be asked — it sweeps proactively, in line with
  `feedback_check_sonar_proactively`.
- The Council's verification-loop has a concrete checklist instead of "looks fine."

The user has SonarLint enabled in their VS Code setup with the highest-signal rules listed here.
ErrorLens surfaces these inline. Claude's job is to address them before declaring a task done.

## Where each topic lives

This file is the routing table. Read the reference file for the topic in hand;
do not carry the whole catalogue to answer one question.

| Topic | Reference file |
| ---- | ---- |
| Wiring SonarJS into a TypeScript / JavaScript repo (mandatory step); stylistic rules to disable; per-file overrides for legitimate exceptions; Eqeqeq + null; Vue / React projects; ESLint guardrails for every TS/JS project | [`references/eslint-setup.md`](references/eslint-setup.md) |
| Mandatory checks on every touched file — the comprehensive TypeScript / JavaScript rule reference (string / regex idioms, style / idiom, type / control-flow, error handling, security, suppression / meta, numerical) and the cross-language quick table | [`references/typescript-rules.md`](references/typescript-rules.md) |
| Sweep procedure; Don't silence — fix; Output expectation | [`references/sweep-and-reporting.md`](references/sweep-and-reporting.md) |
| Cross-language Sonar coverage — Go (SonarGo / golangci-lint), Python (SonarPy / ruff), Java (SonarJava), C# (SonarC#), Swift (SwiftLint), Rust (clippy) | [`references/cross-language.md`](references/cross-language.md) |
| Full SonarJS catalog — every rule, all 269, with ESLint rule name and `sonarjs/recommended` default | [`references/sonarjs-catalog.md`](references/sonarjs-catalog.md) |

## Learning hooks

Per `~/.claude/rules/common/continuous-learning-mandate.md`:

**Signals to watch**:

- New TS/JS repo opened without `eslint-plugin-sonarjs` wired (mandatory-step weakening)
- SonarLint IDE warnings ignored / dismissed across multiple sessions on the same project
- Per-line `// eslint-disable` / `// @ts-ignore` introduced to silence a Sonar rule (rule-violation
  shortcut)
- File-level grep sweep skipped on touched-file audit (sweep procedure step 2 weakening)
- Recurring rule fires in the same file (e.g., S1192 fires 3× per quarter on `apiClient.ts`) — the
  underlying pattern needs structural fix
- Threshold-tightening note out of sync with `extreme-lint-policy.md` (canonical thresholds drift)
- Cross-language equivalents missing on touched files (Go / Python / Java / C# / Swift / Rust
  per-language equivalents skipped)
- Stylistic disable-list grows with rules that produce real bugs (over-disabling — recurrence audit
  needed)

**Refinement candidates**:

- New rule row when a new SonarJS rule ships (the catalog regularly grows; add columns + fix
  recipes)
- Tightening of the disabled-rules list when a previously-stylistic rule starts catching real bugs
- New cross-language entry when a recurring shape gains a Sonar equivalent in another language
  (e.g., SonarRust ships)
- Promotion of a per-file Sonar exception to a project-wide allowlist with documented rationale
  (e.g., SSRF validator file exempt from S1313 by design)
