## Purpose

Principal-level engineering guidance for building clinical data
interoperability into health-tech systems. Covers FHIR R5 +
R4 (still the production majority through 2026-2027), HL7 v2
(the workhorse of US EHRs since 1989), CDA / CCDA documents,
SMART on FHIR launch flows, USCDI v4 (the US federal data
floor as of 2024), DICOM imaging, clinical terminologies
(ICD-10-CM / ICD-10-PCS / SNOMED-CT / LOINC / RxNorm / CPT /
HCPCS), telehealth + mHealth platforms (Apple HealthKit, Google
Health Connect), and the ONC information-blocking + Cures Act
API mandates.

**Out of scope (deliberate)**:

- HIPAA regulation + BAAs + breach + audit — covered by
  `hipaa-compliance`
- Generic security baseline — covered by `security` + `owasp-asvs`
- FDA SaMD device classification — separate domain
- Clinical decision support algorithms — separate scope (this
  skill covers the data shapes; algorithm validation is its own
  discipline)
- Medical billing claims (837/835) — separate revenue-cycle scope

## Core Patterns

### Pattern 1: FHIR R5 vs R4 — version your APIs explicitly

Most US production EHR APIs (Epic, Cerner/Oracle, athenahealth,
Allscripts/Veradigm, eClinicalWorks) expose R4. R5 is the
current normative release but adoption lags 3-5 years. The
right pattern: expose BOTH R4 and R5 endpoints during
transition. Per `api-versioning.md`:

```text
GET /fhir/R4/Patient/123
GET /fhir/R5/Patient/123
```

Mark each with `CapabilityStatement` resource declaring the
exact version + profile compliance. Consumers negotiate via
`Accept: application/fhir+json; fhirVersion=4.0`.

### Pattern 2: US Core profiles, not raw FHIR

Raw FHIR is too permissive for interoperability. US Core
Implementation Guide constrains FHIR to required + must-support
elements for US national use. For every resource, validate
against the US Core profile:

| Resource | US Core profile (STU 7.0) |
| --- | --- |
| Patient | `http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-patient` |
| Encounter | `http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-encounter` |
| Condition | `http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-condition-problems-health-concerns` |
| Observation (vitals) | `http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-vital-signs` |
| Observation (labs) | `http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-laboratory-result-observation` |
| MedicationRequest | `http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-medicationrequest` |
| AllergyIntolerance | `http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-allergyintolerance` |
| Procedure | `http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-procedure` |
| DiagnosticReport (lab) | `http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-diagnosticreport-lab` |
| Immunization | `http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-immunization` |

Use a validator (HL7 FHIR Validator, Inferno test framework,
HAPI ValidatorEngine) in CI. Resources that don't validate are
not interoperable.

### Pattern 3: USCDI v4 is the data floor

USCDI v4 (effective Jan 1, 2026) defines the minimum data set
that ONC-certified Health IT MUST exchange. Categories:

- Patient Demographics + Identifiers
- Allergies + Intolerances
- Assessment + Plan of Treatment
- Care Team Members
- Clinical Notes
- Clinical Tests
- Diagnostic Imaging
- Encounter Information
- Goals
- Health Insurance Information
- Health Status
- Immunizations
- Laboratory
- Medications
- Patient Summary
- Problems
- Procedures
- Provenance
- Smoking Status
- Unique Device Identifiers
- Vital Signs
- (new in v4) Facility Information, Care Plan, Health Concerns

If you're under ONC certification (real EHRs, payer portals
serving CMS-regulated populations), USCDI is non-optional.
If you're a non-certified app, USCDI is still the practical
baseline for what consumers expect.

### Pattern 4: SMART on FHIR launch contexts

Two launch types:

- **EHR Launch** — clinician clicks app from inside EHR; EHR
  provides launch context (patient, encounter, user). OAuth 2.0
  authorization with `launch` scope.
- **Standalone Launch** — patient launches app independently;
  app initiates OAuth with EHR. Patient selects context (or app
  has prior context via refresh token).

Scopes follow SMART syntax:

- `patient/Observation.r` — read patient's observations
- `patient/*.cruds` — full access in patient context
- `user/Patient.r` — user-level access to patients in their
  scope
- `system/Bulk.r` — system-level bulk export (backend)
- `launch/patient` — receive patient context at launch
- `online_access` — offline refresh token
- `openid fhirUser` — OIDC identity claims

Always validate the `aud` claim matches your FHIR endpoint.
Always validate the JWT signature via JWKS. Refresh tokens
rotate on use (per SMART v2.2.0 + OAuth 2.1).

### Pattern 5: Bulk FHIR for population-level export

For payer-to-payer (CMS-9115-F), public health, research,
quality reporting — single-resource API is too chatty. Use
Bulk FHIR async export:

```text
GET /fhir/Group/[id]/$export?_type=Patient,Observation,Condition&_since=2026-01-01
```

Returns 202 Accepted + `Content-Location` for status polling.
Final output: NDJSON files per resource type stored at signed
URLs (24h TTL typical). Each line one resource. Consumers
stream-parse. Implement with chunked async jobs +
backpressure; don't materialize 10M-patient export in memory.

### Pattern 6: HL7 v2 — still the EHR backbone

HL7 v2 (pipe + caret delimited) carries 80%+ of intra-hospital
clinical messaging in the US. Modern systems integrate by
parsing v2 → FHIR. Common message types:

| Trigger | Message | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A01 | ADT | Patient admission |
| A03 | ADT | Patient discharge |
| A04 | ADT | Patient registration |
| A08 | ADT | Patient update |
| O01 | ORM | Order entry |
| R01 | ORU | Observation result |
| S12 | SIU | Schedule new appointment |
| T02 | MDM | Document transcription |
| Z01-Z99 | Custom | Vendor-specific |

Acknowledgement model: every message gets an ACK (AA accept,
AE error, AR reject). Production v2 pipelines use MLLP over
TCP with TLS (HL7 v2 over MLLP RFC 4571 + RFC 5246+). Modern
deployments use HL7 FHIR Subscription resource OR Kafka /
EventBridge wrappers over HTTPS.

### Pattern 7: Terminology — code, don't free-text

Every clinical concept gets a code from a standard system:

| Concept | Primary system | Backup |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Diagnosis | ICD-10-CM | SNOMED-CT |
| Lab result | LOINC | local code + map |
| Medication | RxNorm | NDC |
| Procedure | CPT (outpatient) / ICD-10-PCS (inpatient) | HCPCS |
| Immunization | CVX | + MVX (manufacturer) |
| Allergy substance | RxNorm / SNOMED-CT / UNII | text fallback |
| Clinical finding | SNOMED-CT | ICD-10 |
| Body site | SNOMED-CT | FMA |
| Race / Ethnicity | OMB 1997 + USCDI v4 expanded | |
| Language | BCP-47 | |

Per FHIR: every coded element is a `CodeableConcept` with
`coding[]` (system + code + display) AND optional `text`.
Never store ONLY the display; the code is the truth, display
is for humans.

### Pattern 8: DICOM imaging — keep PHI out of pixels

DICOM files contain PHI in the metadata header (PatientName,
PatientID, AccessionNumber, InstitutionName, study date,
referring physician, etc.). The pixel data often contains
"burned-in" PHI in radiograph corners. Two patterns:

- **De-identification**: strip / pseudonymize headers per DICOM
  PS3.15 Annex E. Tools: dcm4che `Anon`, gdcm `gdcmanon`,
  pydicom `Deid`. Verify "burned-in PHI" header (0028,0301) +
  visual review.
- **DICOMweb** — modern RESTful access (WADO-RS for retrieval,
  STOW-RS for store, QIDO-RS for query). Standard in cloud-
  hosted PACS (AWS HealthImaging, Google Healthcare API).

### Pattern 9: Telehealth — state licensure + ATA standards

Telehealth platforms must respect state-level medical licensure
(provider must hold license in patient's state at time of
encounter), DEA registration for controlled-substance
prescribing (Ryan Haight Act / DEA in-person exception via 2023
final rule), and informed consent per state law. Technical
layer:

- WebRTC for video + audio (DTLS-SRTP encryption)
- HIPAA-eligible video providers (Zoom Healthcare, Doxy.me,
  Twilio Video Healthcare, AWS Chime SDK with BAA)
- Recording: explicit patient consent + 6-year retention
  (HIPAA audit + state malpractice statute of limitations)
- Geolocation check: confirm both provider + patient in
  expected jurisdictions

ATA (American Telemedicine Association) Practice Guidelines
2025 cover modality-specific clinical standards.

### Pattern 10: mHealth — HealthKit / Health Connect

Mobile health platforms integrate with:

- **iOS HealthKit** — read user-granted samples; cannot read
  without explicit per-type permission; cannot back up to
  iCloud without user consent
- **Android Health Connect** — Google's replacement for Google
  Fit, mediates access between apps
- **W3C WebHID + WebBluetooth** — for direct device pairing in
  browsers (limited support)

Data exported from HealthKit / Health Connect to your servers
BECOMES ePHI under HIPAA (if you're a BA / CE) AND falls under
the FTC Health Breach Notification Rule (2024 final rule) if
you're not — yes, BOTH can apply to different data segments.

## Anti-Patterns

### Anti-pattern 1: Free-text where a code exists

"Diabetes type 2" as a string is uninteroperable. SNOMED-CT
44054006 + ICD-10 E11.x is. Always require coded
representation; free text is a backup, not the truth.

### Anti-pattern 2: Custom FHIR profiles without IG

Inventing your own `Observation` extension without a published
Implementation Guide breaks every consumer. Either use US Core

- existing IGs (CARIN BB, Da Vinci, IPS, Argonaut) OR publish
a formal IG with profile + value sets + examples on
simplifier.net / FHIR registry.

### Anti-pattern 3: HL7 v2 parser hand-rolled

V2's pipe + caret + ampersand + tilde + subcomponent escaping
has produced incident reports for 30+ years. Use HAPI-HL7 v2
(Java), python `hl7`, NodeJS `simple-hl7` or `nhl7`. Never
hand-roll the parser.

### Anti-pattern 4: PHI in DICOM headers

Sharing a DICOM study with research / vendor without
de-identification leaks PatientName, ReferringPhysician,
StudyDate, etc. Always run de-identification per DICOM PS3.15

- visual review for burned-in PHI before share.

### Anti-pattern 5: SMART on FHIR scopes too broad

`user/*.cruds` granted to a patient app is over-scope. Match
scope to use case: `patient/Observation.r` for a vitals app,
`patient/MedicationRequest.r` for a medication-list app.

### Anti-pattern 6: FHIR resources stored as opaque JSON

blobs

Storing the entire `Observation` as a JSON column means you
can't query "all glucose readings > 200 in the last 30 days"
without app-level scan. Either: (a) extract key fields to
typed columns + retain full FHIR for round-tripping, OR (b)
use a FHIR-native store (HAPI FHIR JPA, AWS HealthLake, Google
Healthcare FHIR Store).

### Anti-pattern 7: Patient.identifier without `system`

A patient ID without the system that issued it is ambiguous.
`Patient.identifier.system = "http://hospital.example/mrn"` +
`value = "12345"` lets consumers disambiguate cross-source
identifiers.

### Anti-pattern 8: Bulk FHIR export without rate-limit +

async

A naive bulk export of a 100K-patient cohort over the
synchronous API ties up workers + breaches timeouts. Always
async via `$export` per Bulk Data IG; never N+1 the
single-resource API for population queries.

### Anti-pattern 9: Telehealth without state-licensure check

If a provider licensed in CA conducts a telehealth visit with a
patient physically in TX, the provider has practiced medicine
in TX without TX licensure — a felony in most states. Check
patient + provider state at session start; refuse the session
if mismatch (unless interstate compact applies — e.g., IMLC,
Nurse Licensure Compact, PT Compact).

### Anti-pattern 10: USCDI fields silently dropped

CMS-certified systems that drop USCDI data (e.g., race /
ethnicity / language) get flagged in interoperability scores +
risk Cures Act information-blocking enforcement. Always
preserve all USCDI elements through your data pipeline; if
unknown, use `null` with a documented reason code (per
FHIR data-absent-reason extension).

## Why This Skill Exists

Clinical data interoperability is mature but fragmented:

- **CMS-9115-F** (Patient Access + Provider Directory APIs):
  effective since Jul 2021; enforcement increasing
- **CMS-0057-F** (Prior Authorization API): effective Jan 2026
  / Jan 2027 with per-day per-claim penalties
- **ONC Cures Act information-blocking**: $1M / violation per
  HHS HTI-1 final rule (2024); enforcement-grade by HHS OIG
- **State-level interoperability mandates**: TEFCA (Trusted
  Exchange Framework + Common Agreement) — voluntary but
  becoming de facto standard

A health-tech system without principal-level interoperability
discipline:

- Cannot connect to Epic / Cerner / athenahealth (which own
  60%+ of US ambulatory + inpatient EHR market)
- Cannot satisfy ONC certification for federal funding
- Cannot serve regulated Medicare / Medicaid / VA populations
- Cannot meet CMS prior-auth + member-access timelines

Conversely, a system with FHIR + US Core + USCDI + SMART
discipline plugs into the broader US health-data graph and
inherits decades of standards investment instead of fighting
it.

Building this in from day one costs schema discipline +
validator wiring + terminology mapping work. Bolting it on
after launch is an 18-month re-architecture that delays every
EHR integration partnership.

**Important disclaimer**: this skill is engineering guidance,
NOT clinical or legal advice. Clinical workflows require RN /
MD / DO / PharmD review. Compliance questions require HIPAA
counsel.

## Learning hooks

Per `~/.claude/rules/common/continuous-learning-mandate.md`:

**Signals to watch**:

- New clinical data ingested without FHIR mapping (free-text strings, opaque codes)
- US Core profile validation absent from CI for FHIR resources (Pattern 2 weakening)
- USCDI v4 element silently dropped through pipeline (Pattern 3 violation + ONC enforcement
  exposure)
- SMART on FHIR scopes broader than use case requires (Anti-pattern 5; over-privileged app)
- HL7 v2 parser hand-rolled instead of HAPI / `hl7` / `simple-hl7` (Anti-pattern 3)
- DICOM share without de-identification + burned-in PHI check (Anti-pattern 4)
- FHIR resource stored as opaque JSON blob with no extracted indices (Anti-pattern 6)
- Bulk FHIR cohort export attempted via single-resource API (Anti-pattern 8)
- Telehealth session without state-licensure check (Anti-pattern 9; criminal exposure)
- HealthKit / Health Connect data flows to backend without HIPAA + FTC Health Breach Rule scope
  evaluation (Pattern 10 weakening)
- Patient identifier stored without `system` (Anti-pattern 7)
- ICD-9 codes lingering in 2026 production (ICD-10 mandatory since Oct 2015)
- LOINC / SNOMED code versions not stored (terminology drift)
- Code release versions stale > 18 months

**Refinement candidates**:

- New FHIR resource row when US Core IG publishes new profile (STU 8.0 expected 2026-2027)
- USCDI version row when ONC publishes v5+ (v4 effective Jan 2026; v5 likely 2027)
- Bulk Data IG version row when ONC publishes v2.1+
- HL7 message-type row when a new trigger gains adoption
- New imaging modality row when DICOM 2026 publishes
- Code system row when a terminology release introduces breaking changes (e.g., ICD-10-CM annual)
- CMS rule row when CMS publishes next phase of interoperability rulemaking
- Cross-reference deepening when sister skill (`hipaa-compliance`, `pci-dss-patterns`) gains overlap
