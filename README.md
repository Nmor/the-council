## Codex support

A separate native installer adds Council skills, specialist roles and compatible
hooks to Codex while preserving your existing configuration and Claude installation:

```bash
python3 bootstrap/codex.py install --dry-run
python3 bootstrap/codex.py install
python3 bootstrap/codex.py verify
```

See [the Codex installation and compatibility guide](docs/CODEX.md) for prerequisites,
hook review/trust, existing-plan mappings, supported behavior and removal. The Claude
installation instructions below continue to apply to Claude Code.

## Why this exists

Out of the box, Claude Code is a powerful generalist. **The Claude
Council** turns it into a 16-division multi-agent Council
operating at *principal-engineer level* across the entire stack:
architecture, security, compliance, ops, data, finance, risk,
strategy, people, ESG, ethics, comms, plus the five core technical
divisions.

The repo includes **26 short Floor rules**, **187 on-demand Library rules**,
**119 skills**, **39 specialist agents** and **33 command workflows**. The default
workflow runs in the main session and uses at most one justified helper at a time.
Full standards remain available when relevant.

The eager Claude contract is **19,428 bytes** (about **4,857 tokens** using bytes/4),
down from 297,740 source bytes before this revision. These are instruction-size
measurements, not billed usage. A fixed 24,576-byte CI cap prevents regression.
Codex defaults to one discoverable Council router with the full library in its catalog.
See [context controls and existing-install migration](docs/CONTEXT.md).
For requested launch videos, [BRAG](docs/BRAG.md) adds a lean creative workflow and an
optional Hyperframes route for Claude and Codex, with local media verification.

> **Two hazards that keep that number honest.** Both were real
> regressions in this repo, and both are invisible until measured.
>
> 1. **Never put a clone of this repo on a workspace's walk-up
>    path.** Claude Code collects config by walking up from the
>    working directory, so a clone at
>    `<parent-of-your-projects>/.claude/` gets loaded a *second*
>    time as "project instructions" alongside the real one in
>    `$HOME` — silently doubling the cold-load for every project
>    under that parent. Keep this repo a **sibling** of your
>    projects, never an ancestor.
> 2. **On-demand guidance still costs context when read.** Keep skill entrypoints
>    concise and load only needed references. Skill selection uses descriptions and
>    explicit invocation; `paths:` is a rule-scoping mechanism, not automatic skill firing.
>
> Re-measure: `node scripts/token-budget.mjs --root . --check`

**For anyone, on any project.** No org-dependency, no SaaS, no
telemetry.

Both flows are fully native to their host platform — Windows
users do **not** need WSL2 or Git Bash. The installer is
idempotent: any existing `~/.claude/` is moved aside to a
timestamped backup before the new one lands. Pass `--dry-run`
(`-DryRun` on PowerShell) to preview, `--force` (`-Force`) to
skip the backup, `--no-ide` (`-NoIde`) to skip IDE integration.
Full options + per-IDE walkthroughs in [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

After install, open any project in any Claude Code-compatible
IDE — the Council fires on the next prompt.

## The Council in 5 paragraphs

### 1. Scale the review to the work

Inspect the task and existing plan, consider relevant architecture, quality,
security and testing concerns, implement and verify. Full phase templates support
high-risk or explicitly deep reviews. Routine work does not need repeated speeches,
questionnaires or additional model sessions.

### 2. Five core divisions, eleven extended

### 3. Veto authority is explicit

| Disagreement type | Decided by |
| --- | --- |
| Technical (architecture vs implementation) | **Division 1** (Architecture) — casting vote |
| Security BLOCKER | **Division 4** (Security) — VETO |
| Regulatory finding (GDPR / CCPA / HIPAA / PCI / SOC2) | **Division 6** (Compliance) — VETO |
| AI safety / fairness / bias | **Division 15** (Ethics) — VETO |
| Blast radius exceeds scope | **Division 11** (Risk) — VETO |
| Anything else unresolved | Escalate to user with named options |

### 4. Verify-before-claim is the law

Every `"done"` / `"shipped"` / `"complete"` / `"100%"` phrase
MUST be preceded — in the same turn — by a verification action
that produced the evidence. The verification block IS the proof.
Claims without proof are downgraded to *"implemented —
verification deferred to X"* with a named unblock task.

### 5. Continuous learning is mandatory

Every Council-mediated task emits a learning candidate to
`~/.claude/audits/learning-events.jsonl`. Candidates that appear
in 2+ workspaces are eligible for promotion to global. Rules
contradicted ≥5 times in 30 days are flagged for refresh. The
system improves itself with every interaction.

## Cross-IDE support

The configuration is IDE-agnostic at the `~/.claude/` layer.
Bootstrap scripts auto-detect installed IDEs and provide opt-in
integration templates.

| IDE | Status | Integration |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **VS Code** | First-class | `templates/ide-configs/vscode/` — settings + recommended extensions |
| **Cursor** | First-class | `templates/ide-configs/cursor/` — VS Code-compatible config |
| **Windsurf** | First-class | `templates/ide-configs/windsurf/` — settings + recommended extensions |
| **JetBrains** (IntelliJ / GoLand / PyCharm / WebStorm / PhpStorm / RubyMine / RustRover / CLion) | First-class | Anthropic's **Claude Code [Beta]** plugin from JetBrains Marketplace plus the shim in `templates/ide-configs/jetbrains/` |
| **Neovim / Emacs** / other terminal-first editors | Best-effort | The `claude` CLI loads `~/.claude/` regardless of editor |

Per-IDE walkthroughs live in [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

## Focused delivery and business skills

Council includes skills for requirements, incidents, integrated releases, test strategy,
context efficiency, data reconciliation, recovery drills, entrepreneurship, pentesting
and CISA-aligned control audits. See [the routing and verification guide](docs/SDLC-SKILLS.md)
for examples and evidence boundaries. These load on demand through the compact router.

## With vs without

<tr>
<td valign="top">

- One generalist agent, one perspective per prompt
- Implicit rules — different in every project
- Vague "done" claims
- No mechanical lint / security / discard gates
- Provider integrations built from npm READMEs
- Project memory + learnings scattered or lost
- Every project starts from a blank `.claude/`
- Documentation drift the moment code changes

</td>
<td valign="top">

- 16 divisions speak on every prompt
- Same standards (OWASP / NIST / ISO / WCAG / GDPR) everywhere
- `"done"` requires same-turn verification — or it's downgraded
- Hook-enforced gates reject discards / suppressions / secrets at edit time
- Provider research mandatory before first handler — primary sources only
- Workspace `.claude/` auto-spawned with rules, skills, plans, memory, audits
- Continuous learning promotes cross-project patterns to global
- `docs-sync-with-code.md` gates ship the doc update in the same PR

## Contributing

This repo is configuration for *your* Claude Code. Treat your
local clone as the source of truth, send PRs upstream when you
discover patterns worth sharing.

Adding a rule / skill / agent:

1. Read [docs/CONTRIBUTING.md](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md).
2. Author against the principal-level template.
3. Cite ≥3 standards matching the audit regex
   `(RFC [0-9]+|ISO/IEC|NIST|OWASP|WCAG|W3C|§|PEP [0-9]+|SLSA|CWE|JEP|SE-[0-9])`.
4. Add anti-patterns table + cross-references + verification checklist.
5. Run `tests/verify-standards-citations.sh` locally.
6. Send a PR — CI runs the three safety nets automatically.

The rule placement decision (global vs project) lives in
[`rules/common/rule-authoring-global-vs-project.md`](rules/common/rule-authoring-global-vs-project.md).

## Cross-IDE support

The configuration is IDE-agnostic at the `~/.claude/` layer.
Bootstrap scripts auto-detect installed IDEs and provide opt-in
integration templates.

| IDE | Status | Integration |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **VS Code** | First-class | `templates/ide-configs/vscode/` — settings + recommended extensions |
| **Cursor** | First-class | `templates/ide-configs/cursor/` — VS Code-compatible config |
| **Windsurf** | First-class | `templates/ide-configs/windsurf/` — settings + recommended extensions |
| **JetBrains** (IntelliJ / GoLand / PyCharm / WebStorm / PhpStorm / RubyMine / RustRover / CLion) | First-class | Anthropic's **Claude Code [Beta]** plugin from JetBrains Marketplace plus the shim in `templates/ide-configs/jetbrains/` |
| **Neovim / Emacs** / other terminal-first editors | Best-effort | The `claude` CLI loads `~/.claude/` regardless of editor |

Per-IDE walkthroughs live in [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

## With vs without

<table>
<tr><th width="50%">Without The Claude Council</th><th width="50%">With The Claude Council</th></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

- One generalist agent, one perspective per prompt
- Implicit rules — different in every project
- Vague "done" claims
- No mechanical lint / security / discard gates
- Provider integrations built from npm READMEs
- Project memory + learnings scattered or lost
- Every project starts from a blank `.claude/`
- Documentation drift the moment code changes

</td>
<td valign="top">

- 16 divisions speak on every prompt
- Same standards (OWASP / NIST / ISO / WCAG / GDPR) everywhere
- `"done"` requires same-turn verification — or it's downgraded
- Hook-enforced gates reject discards / suppressions / secrets at edit time
- Provider research mandatory before first handler — primary sources only
- Workspace `.claude/` auto-spawned with rules, skills, plans, memory, audits
- Continuous learning promotes cross-project patterns to global
- `docs-sync-with-code.md` gates ship the doc update in the same PR

## Contributing

This repo is configuration for *your* Claude Code. Treat your
local clone as the source of truth, send PRs upstream when you
discover patterns worth sharing.

Adding a rule / skill / agent:

1. Read [docs/CONTRIBUTING.md](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md).
2. Author against the principal-level template.
3. Cite ≥3 standards matching the audit regex
   `(RFC [0-9]+|ISO/IEC|NIST|OWASP|WCAG|W3C|§|PEP [0-9]+|SLSA|CWE|JEP|SE-[0-9])`.
4. Add anti-patterns table + cross-references + verification checklist.
5. Run `tests/verify-standards-citations.sh` locally.
6. Send a PR — CI runs the three safety nets automatically.

The rule placement decision (global vs project) lives in
[`rules/common/rule-authoring-global-vs-project.md`](rules/common/rule-authoring-global-vs-project.md).
